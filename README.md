# Cancer Abstract Dataset

Welcome to the Cancer Abstract Dataset repository! This dataset provides a comprehensive collection of research abstracts related to various types of cancer, aimed at supporting research and analysis in oncology.

## Dataset Overview

The Cancer Abstract Dataset contains abstracts categorized by different cancer types. The dataset is intended for research purposes and provides a foundation for text mining, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning applications in cancer research.

### Dataset Details

- **Total Samples**: 1,874
- **Format**: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- **Fields**:
  - `Abstract`: The full text of the research abstract.
  - `Category`: The type of cancer or study focus (e.g., Lung_Cancer, Thyroid_Cancer, Colon_Cancer, Generic).

### Sample Data

Here are some sample abstracts from the dataset:

| **Abstract** | **Category** |
|--------------|--------------|
| Lung cancer is one of the commonest malignant neoplasms all over the world. It accounts for more cancer deaths than any other cancer. It is increasingly being recognized in India. | Lung_Cancer |
| MicroRNAs have become recognized as key players in the development of cancer. They are a family of small non-coding RNAs that can negatively regulate the expression of cancer-related genes by sequence-selective targeting of mRNAs, leading to either mRNA degradation or translational repression. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide with a substantially low survival rate. MicroRNAs have been confirmed to play roles in lung cancer development, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and response to therapy. They are also being studied for their future use as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and as potential therapeutic targets. In this review we focus on the role of dysregulated microRNA expression in lung tumorigenesis. We also discuss the role of microRNAs in therapeutic resistance and as biomarkers. We further look into the progress made and challenges remaining in using microRNAs for therapy in lung cancer. | Lung_Cancer |
| The objective of this study was to define the epidemiology of thyroid cancer in our regional population and compare results with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program cancer registry trends. | Thyroid_Cancer |
| Silvia Novello speaks to Roshaine Wijayatunga, Managing Commissioning Editor: Silvia Novello is a Full Professor of Medical Oncology in the Oncology Department at San Luigi Hospital in Orbassano, Italy, part of the University of Turin. She earned her medical degree and completed the postgraduate training in respiratory medicine and medical oncology at the University of Turin and partially at the Institut Gustave Roussy in France. Currently, she is head of the Thoracic Oncology Unit at the San Luigi Hospital, Orbassano (Turin), where she also tutors medical students and postgraduate students in respiratory medicine and medical oncology. Novello's research interests include thoracic malignancies, primary prevention, gender differences in lung cancer, basic and clinical applied research on lung cancer, including pharmacogenomics. She is involved in many European and national controlled clinical trials evaluating new approaches in diagnosis and lung cancer therapy. From July 2012 until 2016, Novello has been a Member of the Board of Directors of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and since October 2016 Member of the Board of Directors of the Italian Association of Medical Oncology and member of other several scientific societies including the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Society of Medical Oncology. Currently, she is the President of Women Against Lung Cancer in Europe, a nonprofit European Association founded in 2006 in Turin, Italy, part of the scientific Committee of Lung cancer Europe and also a member of the Scientific Committee of Bonnie J Addario Lung Cancer Foundation and Member of the Scientific Committee of Investigacion sobre Cancer de Pulmon en Mujeres. She is the author or co-author of over 100 publications in peer-reviewed journals. | Lung_Cancer |
