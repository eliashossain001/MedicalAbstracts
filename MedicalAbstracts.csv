Lung cancer is one of the commonest malignant neoplasms all over the world. It accounts for more cancer deaths than any other cancer. It is increasingly being recognized in India.,Lung_Cancer
"MicroRNAs have become recognized as key players in the development of cancer. They are a family of small non-coding RNAs that can negatively regulate the expression of cancer-related genes by sequence-selective targeting of mRNAs, leading to either mRNA degradation or translational repression. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide with a substantially low survival rate. MicroRNAs have been confirmed to play roles in lung cancer development, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and response to therapy. They are also being studied for their future use as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and as potential therapeutic targets. In this review we focus on the role of dysregulated microRNA expression in lung tumorigenesis. We also discuss the role of microRNAs in therapeutic resistance and as biomarkers. We further look into the progress made and challenges remaining in using microRNAs for therapy in lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer

"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA), and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (proGRP) can be used as tumor markers for lung cancer. CEA is sensitive for adenocarcinoma, SCC and CYFRA for squamous cell carcinoma, and NSE and proGRP for small cell carcinoma. A tumor marker is generally used as a marker to monitor the clinical course. Serum levels of pro-GRP, reflect the disease course of patients with small cell lung cancer more accurately than NSE or CEA. Among the patients with clinical N0-1 non-small cell lung cancer high serum CEA levels, adenocarcinoma histology, and large tumor dimension were significant predictors of pathologic N2 disease. CEA played a new role in predicting metastasis to mediastinal lymph nodes A more effective treatment may enhance the value of tumor markers to predict relapse.",Lung_Cancer
"Thyroid cancer can be associated with thyrotoxicosis caused by Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, or autonomously functioning thyroid adenoma. The objective of this study was to summarize current evidence regarding the association of thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism, particularly with respect to the type of hyperthyroidism found in some patients, and whether this affects the outcome of the patient. A PubMed search was performed up to August 2011. Articles were identified using combinations of the following keywords/phrases: thyroid cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, follicular thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid cancer, anaplastic thyroid cancer, hyperthyroidism, Graves' disease, auto-nomous adenoma, toxic thyroid nodule, and toxic multinodular goiter. Original research papers, case reports, and review articles were included. We concluded that the incidence, as well as the prognosis of thyroid cancer associated with hyperthyroidism is a matter of debate. It seems that Graves' disease is associated with larger, multifocal, and potentially more aggressive thyroid cancer than single hot nodules or multinodular toxic goiter. Patients with Graves' and thyroid nodules are at higher risk to develop thyroid cancer compared to patients with diffuse goiter. Every suspicious nodule associated with hyperthyroidism should be evaluated carefully.",Thyroid_Cancer

"LRP1 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1), a multifunctional endocytic receptor, has recently been identified as a hub within a biomarker network for multi-cancer clinical outcome prediction. As its role in colon cancer has not yet been characterized, we here investigate the relationship between LRP1 and outcome.",Colon_Cancer
"Projecting climate change is a generalization problem: We extrapolate the recent past using physical models across past, present, and future climates. Current climate models require representations of processes that occur at scales smaller than model grid size, which have been the main source of model projection uncertainty. Recent machine learning (ML) algorithms hold promise to improve such process representations but tend to extrapolate poorly to climate regimes that they were not trained on. To get the best of the physical and statistical worlds, we propose a framework, termed ""climate-invariant"" ML, incorporating knowledge of climate processes into ML algorithms, and show that it can maintain high offline accuracy across a wide range of climate conditions and configurations in three distinct atmospheric models. Our results suggest that explicitly incorporating physical knowledge into data-driven models of Earth system processes can improve their consistency, data efficiency, and generalizability across climate regimes.",Generic
"Over the last decade, surgical management of colon cancer became more individualized due to new preoperative, surgical and oncological strategies. Recent high-level evidence demonstrated a favorable impact of these advanced concepts, which require proper planning and challenging surgical management form a technical standpoint, on cancer-specific survival. To tailor the best strategy, cases have to be discussed in multidisciplinary tumor boards with specialists in medical oncology, radiology, gastroenterology and pathology. In this review, these innovations are summarized within their scientific context, with focus on new strategies of preoperative bowel preparation, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and technical aspects, to illustrate the complexity of current colon cancer management.",Colon_Cancer
"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, and the majority of diagnoses are made in former smokers. While avoidance of tobacco abuse and smoking cessation clearly will have the greatest impact on lung cancer development, effective chemoprevention could prove to be more effective than treatment of established disease. Chemoprevention is the use of dietary or pharmaceutical agents to reverse or inhibit the carcinogenic process and has been successfully applied to common malignancies other than lung. Despite previous studies in lung cancer chemoprevention failing to identify effective agents, our ability to determine higher risk populations and the understanding of lung tumor and pre-malignant biology continues to advance. Additional biomarkers of risk continue to be investigated and validated. The World Health Organization/International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer classification for lung cancer now recognizes distinct histologic lesions that can be reproducibly graded as precursors of non-small cell lung cancer. For example, carcinogenesis in the bronchial epithelium starts with normal epithelium and progresses through hyperplasia, metaplasia, dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ to invasive squamous cell cancer. Similar precursor lesions exist for adenocarcinoma, and these pre-malignant lesions are targeted by chemopreventive agents in current and future trials. At this time, chemopreventive agents can only be recommended as part of well-designed clinical trials, and multiple trials are currently in progress and additional trials are in the planning stages. This review will discuss the principles of chemoprevention, summarize the completed trials, and discuss ongoing and potential future trials with a focus on targeted pathways.",Lung_Cancer
"The machine learning field, which can be briefly defined as enabling computers make successful predictions using past experiences, has exhibited an impressive development recently with the help of the rapid increase in the storage capacity and processing power of computers. Together with many other disciplines, machine learning methods have been widely employed in bioinformatics. The difficulties and cost of biological analyses have led to the development of sophisticated machine learning approaches for this application area. In this chapter, we first review the fundamental concepts of machine learning such as feature assessment, unsupervised versus supervised learning and types of classification. Then, we point out the main issues of designing machine learning experiments and their performance evaluation. Finally, we introduce some supervised learning methods.",Generic

"This study aims to clarify the presently uncertain value of mass screening for thyroid cancer, which has been performed by physical examination along with mass screening for breast cancer in Zentsuji, Japan since 1983. Among 18,619 subjects, 36 individuals with thyroid cancer (0.19%) were found. The detection rate was 0.40% at the initial screening and 0.10% during subsequent periodic screening. All thyroid cancers were confirmed histologically as well differentiated carcinoma. The tumor size in the mass-screening group (14 +/- 6 mm) was significantly smaller than in patients presenting at an outpatient clinic during the same period (19 +/- 13 mm) (p < 0.05). The incidence of nodal metastases in the mass-screening group (38%) was significantly lower than in the outpatient group (68%) (p < 0.05). Thus mass screening seemed to find thyroid cancers in a relatively early stage. Mass screening for thyroid cancer was economic in this instance because it was performed together with screening for other cancers, such as breast cancer. Thyroid cancer screening required less than one additional minute per subject. The ultimate aim of mass screening is to reduce mortality. No improvement in prognosis from enforced mass screening for thyroid cancer was detected in this study. It cannot be demonstrated that there is sufficient value of mass screening for thyroid cancer to perform it independently despite early cancer detection.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The aim of this study was to explore the effects of the lncRNA ENST00000623984 on colorectal cancer. In this study, the expression levels of ENST000000623984 were first examined in tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissue from 40 patients with colorectal cancer and LoVo cells using quantitative real-time PCR. By siRNA transfection, ENST00000623984 expression was knocked down. Using flow cytometry, cell cycle progression and cell viability were examined in basal and knockdown LoVo cells. The CCK-8 assay was used to assess the cell proliferation rate, and the Transwell assay was used to determine the migration and invasion abilities. The ENST000000623984 expression level was increased in colorectal cancer. Knockdown of ENST000000623984 reduced cell viability, proliferation rate, cell migration and invasion. These results suggested that lncRNA ENST000000623984 may be involved in colorectal cancer development.",Colon_Cancer
"Cancer is now the second leading cause of death in Brazil (after cardiovascular diseases) and a public health problem, with around 500,000 new cases in 2012. Excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer, lung cancer is the second most incident cancer type in men, with 17,210 expected new cases. In women, it is the fifth most incident cancer, with 10,110 expected new cases. The estimated age-adjusted lung cancer mortality rate is about 13/100,000 for men and 5.4/100,000 for women. Lung cancer rates in men increased until the early 1990s and decreased thereafter, especially in the younger population. In contrast, a steady upward trend was observed for women. The positive effects in men were probably due to the successful anti-tobacco campaign conducted in Brazil over the last decades, which led to a decrease in the adult smoking population, from 32% in the early 1980s to 17% in the 2000s. Although the Brazilian National Cancer Institute is strongly committed to providing excellence in multimodality care to cancer patients, limitations in availability and adequate geographic distribution of specialists and well-equipped cancer centers are evident. Major disparities in patient access to proper staging and state-of-the-art treatment still exist. Considering that World Health Organization (WHO) officials estimate that cancer will become the number one cause of death in most developing countries, including Brazil, in the next decades, it is highly recommended for government authorities to implement firm actions to face this tremendous challenge.",Lung_Cancer
"The prevalence of thyroid cancer the most frequent endocrine malignancy, is rapidly increasing. Most of thyroid cancers are relatively indolent, however, some cases still possess a risk of developing into lethal types of thyroid cancer. Regarding its multistep tumorigenesis, the determination of the underlying mechanisms is a vital issue for thyroid cancer therapy. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of non-coding RNAs with a closed loop structure. Numerous circRNAs have been identified in cancerous tissues. Mounting data recommends that the biological activities of circRNAs, such as serving as microRNA or ceRNAs sponges, interacting with proteins, modulating gene translation and transcription, suggesting that circRNAs will be potential targets as well as agents for the prognosis and diagnosis of diseases, including cancer. Given that circular RNAs acts as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in the thyroid cancer. Several studies documented that circular RNAs via microRNA and protein sponges could regulate a sequences of cellular and molecular mechanisms e.g., apoptosis, angiogenesis, tumor growth, and invasion that are involved in thyroid cancer pathogenesis. Herein, we summarized the role of circular RNAs as therapeutic and diagnostic biomarkers in the thyroid cancer. Moreover, we highlighted the role of these molecules in the pathogenesis of various cancers.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Lung cancer incidence is increasing. Survivability has increased over the last few years particularly in certain subsets and has also been shown to increase with early detection. Chest X-ray and sputum cytology have been the mainstays of screening programs. Although survival is increased, overall mortality rates seem unchanged except in certain subsets. Whether the addition of serum markers or use of monoclonal antibodies, automated cytological, and computer-aided techniques will show decrease in mortality remains to be documented. We recommend yearly chest X-rays, sputum cytology in high-risk patients, i.e., age greater than 65, greater than 20 year history smoking, other significant carcinogenic exposure. Serum markers, monoclonal antibodies, and advanced, automated cytology methods are yet to be tested and therefore should be considered in clinical trials only.",Lung_Cancer

"Sublobar resection has been utilized as an alternative to lobectomy for the treatment of early-stage lung cancer in patients with compromised preoperative pulmonary function. Early data have suggested higher rates of local recurrence and increased late mortality for sublobar resection as compared with lobectomy. Subsequent studies have been mixed with respect to outcomes. Here we review the existing literature comparing sublobar resection to lobectomy with respect to oncologic and pulmonary outcomes. We also discuss the effect of adjuvant intraoperative brachytherapy to sublobar resection and summarize ongoing clinical trials that compare sublobar resection to sublobar resection plus adjuvant brachytherapy in the treatment of early-stage lung cancer. Finally, based on the current evidence, we provide recommendations as to when sublobar resection might be considered in the treatment of lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer

"In the United States, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women even though an extensive list of risk factors has been well-characterized. Far and away the most important cause of lung cancer is exposure to tobacco smoke through active or passive smoking. The reductions in smoking prevalence in men that occurred in the late 1960s through the 1980s will continue to drive the lung cancer mortality rates downward in men during the first portion of this century. This favorable trend will not persist unless further reductions in smoking prevalence are achieved.",Lung_Cancer
"Well differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in children is characterized by a high rate of response to treatment and low disease-specific mortality. Treatment of children with DTC has evolved toward a greater reliance on evaluation and monitoring with serial serum thyroglobulin measurements and ultrasound examinations. Radioiodine therapy is recommended for thyroid remnant ablation in high-risk patients, treatment of demonstrated radioiodine-avid local-regional disease not amenable to surgical resection, or distant radioiodine-avid metastatic disease. Sufficient time should be given for benefits of radioiodine therapy to be realized, with follow-up monitoring. Re-treatment with radioiodine can be deferred until progression of significant disease manifests.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Telomeres are specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes, consisting of hundreds of repeated hexanucleotides (TTAGGG)n. Genetic integrity is partly maintained by the architecture of telomeres and it is gradually lost as telomeres progressively shorten with each cell replication, due to incomplete lagging DNA strand synthesis and oxidative damage. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase enzyme that counteracts telomere shortening by adding telomeric repeats to the G-rich strand. It is composed of a telomerase RNA component and a protein component, telomerase reverse transcriptase. In the absence of telomerase or when the activity of the enzyme is low compared to the replicative erosion, apoptosis is triggered. Patients who have inherited genetic defects in telomere maintenance seem to have an increased risk of developing familial benign diseases or malignant diseases. At the somatic level, telomerase is reactivated in the majority of human carcinomas, suggesting that telomerase reactivation is a critical step for cancerogenesis.In sporadic thyroid carcinoma telomerase activity is detectable in nearly 50% of thyroid cancer tissues and some authors proposed that the detection of telomerase activity may be used for differentiating between benign and malignant thyroid tumours. Recently a germline alteration of telomere-telomerase complex has been identified in patients with familial papillary thyroid cancer, characterized by short telomeres and increased expression and activity of telomerase compared to patients with sporadic papillary thyroid cancer.In this report, we will review the role of telomere-telomerase complex in sporadic and familial thyroid cancer.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. Although smoking prevention and cessation programs have decreased lung cancer mortality, there remains a large at-risk population. Dismal long-term survival rates persist despite improvements in diagnosis, staging, and treatment. Early efforts to identify an effective screening test have been unsuccessful. Recent advances in multidetector computed tomography have allowed screening studies using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) to be performed. This set the stage for the National Lung Screening Trial that found that annual LDCT screening benefits individuals at high risk for lung cancer. An understanding of the harmful effects of lung cancer screening is required to help maximize the benefits and decrease the risks of a lung cancer screening program. Although many questions remain regarding LDCT screening, a comprehensive lung cancer screening program of high-risk individuals will increase detection of preclinical and potentially curable disease, creating a new model of lung cancer surveillance and management.",Lung_Cancer
"Precision medicine is an emerging approach to clinical research and patient care that focuses on understanding and treating disease by integrating multi-modal or multi-omics data from an individual to make patient-tailored decisions. With the large and complex datasets generated using precision medicine diagnostic approaches, novel techniques to process and understand these complex data were needed. At the same time, computer science has progressed rapidly to develop techniques that enable the storage, processing, and analysis of these complex datasets, a feat that traditional statistics and early computing technologies could not accomplish. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, is a computer science methodology that aims to identify complex patterns in data that can be used to make predictions or classifications on new unseen data or for advanced exploratory data analysis. Machine learning analysis of precision medicine's multi-modal data allows for broad analysis of large datasets and ultimately a greater understanding of human health and disease.

"Cyber attacks have been increasingly detrimental to networks, systems, and users, and are increasing in number and severity globally. To better predict system vulnerabilities, cybersecurity researchers are developing new and more holistic approaches to characterizing cybersecurity system risk. The process must include characterizing the human factors that contribute to cyber security vulnerabilities and risk. Rationality, expertise, and maliciousness are key human characteristics influencing cyber risk within this context, yet maliciousness is poorly characterized in the literature. There is a clear absence of literature pertaining to human factor maliciousness as it relates to cybersecurity and only limited literature relating to aspects of maliciousness in other disciplinary literatures, such as psychology, sociology, and law. In an attempt to characterize human factors as a contribution to cybersecurity risk, the Cybersecurity Collaborative Research Alliance (CSec-CRA) has developed a Human Factors risk framework. This framework identifies the characteristics of an attacker, user, or defender, all of whom may be adding to or mitigating against cyber risk. The maliciousness literature and the proposed maliciousness assessment metrics are discussed within the context of the Human Factors Framework and Ontology. Maliciousness is defined as the intent to harm. Most maliciousness cyber research to date has focused on detecting malicious software but fails to analyze an individual's intent to do harm to others by deploying malware or performing malicious attacks. Recent efforts to identify malicious human behavior as it relates to cybersecurity, include analyzing motives driving insider threats as well as user profiling analyses. However, cyber-related maliciousness is neither well-studied nor is it well understood because individuals are not forced to expose their true selves to others while performing malicious attacks. Given the difficulty of interviewing malicious-behaving individuals and the potential untrustworthy nature of their responses, we aim to explore the maliciousness as a human factor through the observable behaviors and attributes of an individual from their actions and interactions with society and networks, but to do so we will need to develop a set of analyzable metrics. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to review human maliciousness-related literature in diverse disciplines (sociology, economics, law, psychology, philosophy, informatics, terrorism, and cybersecurity); and (2) to identify an initial set of proposed assessment metrics and instruments that might be culled from in a future effort to characterize human maliciousness within the cyber realm. The future goal is to integrate these assessment metrics into holistic cybersecurity risk analyses to determine the risk an individual poses to themselves as well as other networks, systems, and/or users.",Generic

"A subset of genetic alterations distinguishes two groups of colon cancers. In the first group instability of microsatellite loci due to a defective DNA mismatch repair system is observed. The second group is characterized by recurrent losses of chromosome regions, frequently associated with hyperploidization. We have developed a technique which enables a fine description of allelic losses in this second group of tumours. The typing of 278 loci in 47 hyperploid colon cancers has provided information for an average of 160 loci per tumour. The high frequency of allelic losses on chromosomes 17, 18 and 5 was confirmed thus validating our methodological approach. Several additional chromosome segments were observed lost in over 40% of the cases, suggesting that tumour suppressor genes may map within these regions. Further technical development should contribute to the identification of these genes.",Colon_Cancer
"Nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma is known to occur in association with primary hyperparathyroidism. A combination of secondary, uremic, hyperparathyroidism and non-medullary thyroid carcinoma is rare and was hitherto reported in only 12 cases. We report another three patients with this parathyroid/thyroid disease combination, suggesting that it may represent not merely a coincidence. A number of factors active in secondary hyperparathyroidism may play a role in the induction and/or promotion of the thyroid cancer. These include parathyroid endocrinopathy, goiterogenic effect of prolonged hypercalcemia, and uremia. During surgery on the parathyroid glands, associated thyroid lesions demand special considerations.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), a major cause of cancer-related death in the western world, is accompanied with alterations of sphingolipid (SL) composition in colon tumors. A number of enzymes involved in the SL metabolism have been found to be deregulated in human colon tumors, in experimental rodent studies, and in human colon cancer cells in vitro. Therefore, the enzymatic pathways that modulate SL levels have received a significant attention, due to their possible contribution to CRC development, or as potential therapeutic targets. Many of these enzymes are associated with an increased sphingosine-1-phosphate/ceramide ratio, which is in turn linked with increased colon cancer cell survival, proliferation and cancer progression. Nevertheless, more attention should also be paid to the more complex SLs, including specific glycosphingolipids, such as lactosylceramides, which can be also deregulated during CRC development. In this review, we focus on the potential roles of individual SLs/SL metabolism enzymes in colon cancer, as well as on the pros and cons of employing the current in vitro models of colon cancer cells for lipidomic studies investigating the SL metabolism in CRC.",Colon_Cancer
"Recently, many tumor sequencing studies have inferred and reported on mutational signatures, short nucleotide patterns at which particular somatic base substitutions appear more often. A number of signatures reflect biological processes in the patient and factors associated with cancer risk.

We also compare the mutational signatures to others in the literature.",Colon_Cancer
"Accurate staging of lung cancer is essential for proper treatment and management of the disease, and allows predictions for patient survival. Several different invasive and noninvasive modalities exist for staging, and the determination of the best approach of one or a combination of those methods depends on the clinical situation and the clinician's assessment of the most appropriate means of staging evaluation.

Compared to conventional thyroidectomy, scarless endoscopic thyroidectomy has a superior cosmetic result. And it also reduces the incidence of hypesthesia, paresthesia, or feelings of self-consciousness. However, the outcome depends, to a large extent, on the skill of the operator and the learning curve being relatively long.

One aspect grossly ignored has been bacterially produced heat which is beyond somatic control. A present day affluent lifestyle includes a more sedentary life, the strongest of all risk factors for colon cancer, with more sitting and less diffusion of bacterial heat, more fat and sugar, rich in energy and less of energy poor foods like cereals.

Tensegrity robots contain compliant networks of rigid struts and soft cables, allowing them to change their shape by adjusting their internal tension. Local rigidity along the struts provides support to carry electronics and scientific payloads, while global compliance enabled by the flexible interconnections of struts and cables allows a tensegrity to distribute impacts and prevent damage. Numerous techniques have been proposed for designing and simulating tensegrity robots, giving rise to a wide range of locomotion modes, including rolling, vibrating, hopping, and crawling. In this study, we review progress in the burgeoning field of tensegrity robotics, highlighting several emerging challenges, including automated design, state sensing, and kinodynamic motion planning.",Generic

"We quantitatively evaluated dendritic cell (DC) infiltration in primary colorectal cancers from 44 patients and metastatic colorectal tumors from 13 patients using immunohistochemistry for the DC marker CD83, HLA-DR, and the DC activation molecules CD40 and CD86. Nearly all CD83+ cells were also HLA-DR+, CD40+, and CD86+, indicating that the DCs that infiltrate colon cancer in vivo express the activation and costimulatory molecules associated with a mature DC phenotype. The density of DCs in colorectal cancer primaries was three times lower than that seen in normal colonic mucosa (0.29 versus 0.84 CD83+ cells/ high-power field (hpf), p < 0.001). Dendritic cells were rarely observed in metastatic tumors: DC density in metastases was sixfold lower than in colorectal primary tumors (0.05 versus 0.29 CD83+ cells/hpf, p < 0.001). Because cytokines have been shown, in vitro, to exert potent effects on DCs, we also evaluated the relationship between intratumor DC density and the expression of cytokines by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor cells. Expression of interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor beta by either TIL or tumor cells was not associated with decreased DC density or decreased expression of CD40 or CD86 on DCs. Tumor expression of vascular endothelial growth factor was associated with a more than twofold increase in DC density (p = 0.01). Patients who had a high proportion of TILs expressing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) had a greater intratumor mature DC density than patients with a low proportion of TNF + TIL (0.54 versus 0.21 CD83+ cells/hpf, p < 0.01).",Colon_Cancer

"At variance with other human malignancies, p53 mutations are not frequent in thyroid cancer and are believed to be responsible mainly for cancer progression to poorly differentiated and aggressive phenotype. p63 and p73, two proteins with a high degree of homology with p53, are overexpressed in thyroid cancer, but their role in cancer initiation or progression is controversial. Regulation of p53 family protein function depends on: (1) the balance between the expression of transcriptionally active (p53, TAp63, and TAp73) and inactive isoforms (DeltaNp63 and DeltaNp73); (2) their interaction and competition at DNA-responsive elements; (3) their interaction with regulatory proteins, either inhibitory or activating. In thyroid cancer, therefore, although mutations of the p53 oncosuppressor protein family are rare, other mechanisms are present, including aberrant expression of p53 family dominant negative isoforms, up-regulation of inhibitory proteins, and functional inhibition of activating proteins. The overall result is a defective oncosuppressor activity. These inactivating mechanisms may be present in the early stages of thyroid cancer and in different cancer histotypes. A better understanding of this complex network may not only ameliorate our comprehension of cancer biology, but also open the possibility of innovative diagnostic procedures and the development of targeted therapies.",Thyroid_Cancer

Fifteen of the 20 cancers (75%) were papillary while five (25%) were follicular. Six individuals (30%) had a history of external radiation to the head and neck as an infant, child, or young adult.

Patients were divided into three groups: group I: four patients (20%) had a neck mass 4, 14, 20, and 41 years after having had a subtotal thyroidectomy (STT) for Graves' disease; three of four had a history of external irradiation therapy. These tumors behaved aggressively, resulting in the death of two of the four patients. group II: 11 patients (55%) had diffusely enlarge toxic goiters without a nodule. A carcinoma was diagnosed intraoperatively on frozen section in only two of these patients. The others received STT. After recognition on permanent section, those carcinomas that were 4 mm or greater in diameter received postoperative RAI. One recurrence occurred and was treated successfully with further RAI. group III: Five patients (25%) had Graves' disease and a palpable thyroid nodule. None of them had had a prior thyroidectomy for Graves' disease, as in group 1. Thyroid carcinoma was diagnosed in all patients preoperatively or intraoperatively, and a total thyroidectomy was performed. Each patient is alive and well with a mean follow-up of 5 years. Between 1971 and 1981, 194 patients had surgery for Graves' disease, and 10 (5.2%) were found to have an associated carcinoma; six patients (3.1% of the total) did not have a nodule or any other suspicion of malignancy before surgery. During the same time, 303 patients received RAI therapy for Graves' disease and one (0.3%) has subsequently developed thyroid carcinoma. Thyroid cancer associated with Graves' disease is found more commonly in surgically treated patients than in patients after RAI therapy. The greatest risk factor in our patients was previous external radiation to the head and neck. Such individuals should be treated with total thyroid ablation rather than the usual STT, since they are at risk of developing aggressive thyroid cancers if thyroid remnants are left.",Thyroid_Cancer
"It is generally held that thyroid cancer is uncommonly associated with thyrotoxicosis. We report here nine patients with thyroid cancer amongst 720 patients with thyrotoxicosis. Three patients presented with features of malignancy together with thyrotoxicosis (Group A), one of whom had triiodothyronine (T3)-toxicosis. The remaining six patients were diagnosed following histological examination of tissues removed during subtotal thyroidectomies for hyperthyroidism (Group B). Two patients in Group A had follicular carcinoma; the rest were papillary in type. All the patients were rendered euthyroid initially, followed by ablative therapy for two patients in Group A and four patients in Group B. All but one are alive after one to nine years (mean of 3 . 4 years). The diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma is infrequently considered in the presence of thyrotoxicosis. The association is not clinically apparent in the majority of patients. The optimum management of such occult malignancies in thyrotoxicosis remains to be defined.",Thyroid_Cancer
"On an average of 6-18 months, actual survival in lung carcinoma (only 20% patients live over 1-2 years) is very modest, in spite of remarkable diagnostic and therapeutic efforts. In a research performed on 304 patients (244 men and 60 women), diagnosed between January 1st 2000 and December 31st 2001, we have studied the survival in function of disease extension over 10 months. A comparison of the survival of the patients diagnosed in the IV-th stage and the other stages respectively I-st, II-nd and III-rd has been realised by a statistical study with the help of test chi2. The percentages in the clinical stages I and IV was of 1.64% and respectively of 48.68% and it demonstrates a very modest survival for the patients diagnosed in the stage IV; disease extension represents a decisive factor in the determinism of this disease. Women survival (of 53.33%) better than that of men (of only 48.36%) can be explained by a more reduced smoking (only 63% at women comparative with 87% at men) and by a more reduced exposure to professional carcinogen agents. Statistical analysis of clinical stages I, II and III in comparison with the clinical stage IV by the help of the test X2, demonstrates that there are significant statistical differences between the clinical stage IV and the other clinical stages.",Lung_Cancer

"Between January 1993 and March 2000, 16 patients underwent carinal resection for lung cancer; primary carcinoma in 15 patients and recurrent disease in 1. Age ranged from 41 to 74 years old, and the mean age was 58 years. Sleeve pneumonectomy was performed in 8 patients, right upper sleeve lobectomy in 7, and only carinal resection for the recurrent lesion in 1 patient. Combined resection of the aorta was performed in 2 patients, superior vena cava, in 5, left atrium and esophageal wall, in 1, and panpleura, in 1.

"To help investors understand the profound impact of Taoism in society, this study systematically evaluates its impact on digital inclusive finance and its mechanisms. Based on theoretical analysis, this study makes an empirical analysis based on Chinese city-level data from 2011 to 2019, in which the core explanatory variable ""Taoism"" encompasses the Taoist places of religious activity in each city, and the explained variable ""digital inclusive finance"" is measured using the Peking University digital inclusive finance index. The results of this study show that (1) the Taoist concept of inaction requires people to put aside selfishness and prejudice, and treat others fairly, rationally, and leniently, which is conducive to the development of digital inclusive finance; (2) the dialectical wisdom of Taoism inspires positive psychological capital, which is conducive to digital and traditional technological innovations and the development of digital inclusive finance; and (3) further research indicates that Taoism encourages Chinese-listed enterprises to actively fulfill their social responsibilities by promoting the development of digital inclusive finance. This study can help global investors understand China's traditional culture and capital markets and serve as the first step in exploring Taoist economics.",Generic

"Neurotensin (NT), a peptide from the distal gut that is released by fat ingestion, stimulates the growth of normal small bowel and colonic mucosa. The purpose of this study was to determine whether chronic administration of NT would affect the growth of a mouse colon cancer (MC-26) and a human colon cancer (LoVo) in vivo. In experiment 1, male Balb/c mice were inoculated with MC-26 cells (5 x 10(4)) and then randomized to four treatment groups receiving either saline (control) or NT (150, 300 or 600 micrograms kg-1) administered subcutaneously (s.c.) every 8 h for 21 days. In experiment 2, 60 mice with MC-26 tumours were randomized to receive saline (control) or NT (300 or 600 micrograms kg-1) for 28 days, and survival was then assessed. In experiment 3, 16 athymic nude mice with LoVo tumour xenografts were randomized to receive either saline (control) or NT (600 micrograms kg-1). We found that administration of NT (300 and 600 micrograms kg-1) significantly stimulated mean tumour area, weight and DNA, RNA and protein content of MC-26 tumours. In addition, the survival rate of mice bearing MC-26 tumours and treated with either dose of NT was significantly decreased compared with the control group given saline injections. Similarly, NT (600 micrograms kg-1) stimulated growth (tumour area, weight and nucleic acid contents) of the human colon cancer, LoVo. We conclude that NT acts as a tropic factor for the colon cancer cell lines MC-26 and LoVo in vivo. NT may play an important role in growth regulation of certain colon cancers.",Colon_Cancer
"Treatment of medullary thyroid cancer is mainly based on surgery. Life expectancy exceeds 10 years in almost half of patients with inoperable advanced or metastatic disease. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally ineffective when this malignancy progresses. Vandetanib (Caprelsa, AstraZeneca), a multiple kinase inhibitor, is authorised in the European Union for use in this setting. Its clinical evaluation is mainly based on a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 331 patients, 70% of whom had progressed within the previous 6 months. Median follow-up (2 years) is too short to detect an impact on overall survival (about 85% in both groups). Analyses based on other outcomes (progression-free survival and pain) are unreliable, due to the large amount of missing data. The adverse effect profile of vandetanib is unfavourable: it includes diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and cutaneous, neuropsychological, haemorrhagic and metabolic disorders. Visual disturbances have also been observed. Vandetanib also prolongs the QT interval: 3 cases of torsades de pointes and 9 sudden deaths have already been reported. Renal failure increases this risk. Numerous pharmacokinetic interactions are likely to occur, notably via cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP 3A4. Vandetanib reduces the effectiveness of levothyroxine. Vandetanib should not be combined with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. The long half-life of vandetanib (about 3 weeks) must be taken into account when managing interactions and adverse effects. There is no firm evidence that vandetanib has a favourable harm-benefit balance in patients with inoperable advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer.",Thyroid_Cancer

"In colon cancer, the activities of polyamine-synthesizing enzymes and polyamine content are increased 3-4-fold over that found in the equivalent normal colonic mucosa, and polyamines have even been attributed as markers of neoplastic proliferation in the colon. Furthermore, and in contrast with all other cell systems in the body, normal and neoplastic cells in the colon are exposed to high concentrations of putrescine from the lumen, synthesized by colonic microflora. While such a high polyamine supply may be of benefit in non-neoplastic colonic mucosal growth, the role of luminal polyamines in colon cancer is a clear concern. Luminal polyamines are readily taken up by neoplastic colonocytes, they are utilized in full to support neoplastic growth, and their uptake is strongly up-regulated by the mitogens known to play an important role in colonic carcinogenesis. Inhibition of polyamine synthesis and their uptake, impaired utilization of exogenous polyamines, and enhanced catabolism of polyamines in neoplastic colonocytes are therefore logical approaches in the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"In recent years, artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning (DL), has demonstrated utility in diverse areas of medicine. DL uses neural networks to automatically learn features from the raw data while this is not possible with conventional machine learning. It is helpful for the assessment of patients with epilepsy and whilst most published studies have been aimed at the automatic detection and prediction of seizures from electroencephalographic records, there is a growing number of investigations that use neuroimaging modalities (structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and positron emission tomography) as input data. We review the application of DL to neuroimaging (sMRI, fMRI, DWI and PET) of focal epilepsy, specifically presurgical evaluation of drug-refractory epilepsy. First, a brief theoretical overview of artificial neural networks and deep learning is presented. Next, we review applications of deep learning to neuroimaging of epilepsy: diagnosis and lateralization, automated detection of lesion, presurgical evaluation and prediction of postsurgical outcome. Finally, the limitations, challenges and possible future directions in the application of these methods in the study of epilepsies are discussed. This approach could become an essential tool in clinical practice, particularly in the evaluation of images considered negative by visual inspection, in individualized treatments, and in the approach to epilepsy as a network disorder.

"We quantitatively evaluated dendritic cell (DC) infiltration in primary colorectal cancers from 44 patients and metastatic colorectal tumors from 13 patients using immunohistochemistry for the DC marker CD83, HLA-DR, and the DC activation molecules CD40 and CD86. Nearly all CD83+ cells were also HLA-DR+, CD40+, and CD86+, indicating that the DCs that infiltrate colon cancer in vivo express the activation and costimulatory molecules associated with a mature DC phenotype. The density of DCs in colorectal cancer primaries was three times lower than that seen in normal colonic mucosa (0.29 versus 0.84 CD83+ cells/ high-power field (hpf), p < 0.001). Dendritic cells were rarely observed in metastatic tumors: DC density in metastases was sixfold lower than in colorectal primary tumors (0.05 versus 0.29 CD83+ cells/hpf, p < 0.001). Because cytokines have been shown, in vitro, to exert potent effects on DCs, we also evaluated the relationship between intratumor DC density and the expression of cytokines by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor cells. Expression of interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor beta by either TIL or tumor cells was not associated with decreased DC density or decreased expression of CD40 or CD86 on DCs. Tumor expression of vascular endothelial growth factor was associated with a more than twofold increase in DC density (p = 0.01). Patients who had a high proportion of TILs expressing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) had a greater intratumor mature DC density than patients with a low proportion of TNF + TIL (0.54 versus 0.21 CD83+ cells/hpf, p < 0.01).",Colon_Cancer

Statistically significant increases in the activity of G-6-PDH, NADP-D and LDH were observed in a decreasing degree of tumour differentiation with a simultaneous relative decrease in the activity of SDH, MDH NAD-D and alpha-GPDH. When the activity of oxidoreductases was compared in tumours having the structure of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, a higher activity of LDH, SDH and alpha-GPDH in squamous cell carcinoma and high activity of G-6-PDH and NADP-D in adenocarcinoma were observed. Statistically significant differences in the activity of carbohydrate metabolism enzymes in small cell carcinoma and other histological forms of lung cancer were found: a significant increase in G-6-PDH and LDH and relative decline in the activity of SDH and alpha-GPDH. In all the examined histological forms of lung cancer there was a complete agreement in the results of histo- and cytospectrophotometric examinations of the activity of the main oxidative-reductive enzymes.",Lung_Cancer
"A total of 201 patients presenting differentiated thyroid gland carcinoma (DTGC), all of them in T1-3Ha-bMo stage, are followed up over a 10-year period, 1980 through 1989. Thyroidectomy with ensuing 131I radiotherapy is used in the treatment of 74 cases, and varying in extent resections--in the remainder. Women up to 50, and men up to 40 years of age (totalling 138 cases) are assigned to low-risk age groups (LRG), and those exceeding the aforementioned age limit (63 cases)--to high-risk age groups (HRG). Local recurrences and lymph node metastases are recorded in 17.5 per cent of the patients undergoing thyroidectomy followed by iodine radiotherapy. Among those subjected to radical resections the rate of recurrences of the lesion amounts to 2.4 per cent. In the HRG the rate of recurrences among thyroidectomized patients is 32 per cent, whereas in those assigned to LRG, treated with organ salvaging operations, the recurrences are 10.1 and 1.1 per cent, respectively. It is established that insofar as recurrences of the lesion are concerned the fifth year remains a high-risk period; by the second year they are increased more than three times. Lymph-node metastases are observed in 80 per cent of the cases by the second year. Local recurrences are more common in HRG--83.3 per cent.

"This synthesis of the literature on radiotherapy for lung cancer is based on 80 scientific articles, including 2 meta-analyses, 29 randomized studies, 19 prospective studies, and 21 retrospective studies. These studies involve 28172 patients. Basic treatment for limited-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC), is chemotherapy. Addition of radiotherapy to the primary tumor and mediastinum reduces local recurrence, prolongs long-term survival, and is often indicated. Current, and future, studies can be expected to show successive improvements in results for SCLC by optimizing the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Should these treatments be given simultaneously or sequentially, and in which order? Which fractionation is best? Probably, no change in resource requirements for radiotherapy will be necessary, with the possible exception of changes in fractionation. Surgery constitutes primary treatment for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stages I and II. Radiotherapy may provide an alternative for patients who are inoperable for medical reasons. The value of radiotherapy following radical surgery for NSCLC remains to be shown. It is not indicated based on current knowledge. For NSCLC stage III, radiotherapy shrinks tumors and prolongs survival at 2 and 3 years. Whether it influences long-term survival after 5 years has not been shown. Considering the side effects of treatment, one must question whether limited improvements in survival motivate routine radiotherapy in these patients. Earlier attempts to add chemotherapy to radiotherapy to improve treatment results of NSCLC have not yielded convincing results. Several studies are currently on-going. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) greatly reduces the risk for brain metastases from SCLC. However, it has little influence on survival. Many treatment centers give PCI to SCLC patients who have achieved complete remission. This practice may be questioned since PCI is associated with serious complications. PCI is not indicated in patients with NSCLC. In SCLC, where the disease is extensive, only palliative radiotherapy is appropriate. Radiotherapy is an important treatment alternative in special palliative situations involving severe cough, severe bleeding, pain, pulmonary obstructions, and vena cava superior syndrome. In these situations, good results may be achieved with few fractions.",Lung_Cancer
"Local, regional and distant tumor recurrence is common following surgical resection for non-small cell lung cancer. It is important to be familiar with the patterns of recurrence and to differentiate them from the normal post-operative appearance and post-radiation changes. The risks and types of recurrence are influenced by various factors including preoperative tumor stage, histological type and type of surgical resection. Treated patients are at risk for developing a second lung primary, reported to be 1-4% per year, and therefore follow-up must be aimed at detecting not only recurrent cancer, but also a new, primary lung cancer.

Understanding these genetic factors and how they influence cellular function will have a profound effect on medical practice. High-risk populations will be (and are being) identified by genetic markers, thus allowing prevention and screening to be more precisely targeted to the population at risk; intervention strategies will be designed on the basis of the known cellular defects of neoplastic colonic mucosa; and new molecular preventive and therapeutic approaches can be developed.",Colon_Cancer

We posit that metabolites generated by gut microbiota can influence CRC through a multitude of epigenetic or genetic effects on malignant transformation. A closer look at the cross talks between the commensals, epithelial cells, immune regulators etc., needs to be established with more substantiated studies. The recurrence of chemoresistant disease following therapy undoubtedly provides the impetus for morbidity and mortality; yet, the role of gut microbiome in drug resistance remains to be fully investigated.

"The human gut microbiota plays a major role in the development and maintenance of good health. Many recent studies have attempted to define links between microbiota residents, their function and the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Gut microbiota drive the development of inflammation within the colon and such inflammation is implicated in colonic neoplastic development. Although the precise mechanisms through which the microbiota is involved in cancer development remain elusive, the message is clear: the microbiota contributes to cancer risk by influencing a number of key host processes. It is also recognized that we have the ability to influence the role of the gut microbiota by considering our nutritional intake. We have always known that 'we are what we eat' but it is also true that 'they (our gut microbiota) are what we eat'. We therefore have a huge opportunity to positively influence our health through microbial manipulation. There is now a clear need to move past defining the constituents of the gastrointestinal microbiota and to focus more on understanding the functional capabilities of the resident microbial community and how this impacts on host health. One such emerging concept is the development of microbial biofilms which can form in the gut in conjunction with CRC tissue. By better understanding of the interaction between the host and its resident microbiota, in the context of health and cancer development, we will open new therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities for reducing the CRC global health burden.",Colon_Cancer

"Archaea are a domain of prokaryotic organisms with intriguing physiological characteristics and ecological importance. In Microbial Biotechnology, archaea are historically overshadowed by bacteria and eukaryotes in terms of public awareness, industrial application, and scientific studies, although their biochemical and physiological properties show a vast potential for a wide range of biotechnological applications. Today, the majority of microbial cell factories utilized for the production of value-added and high value compounds on an industrial scale are bacterial, fungal or algae based. Nevertheless, archaea are becoming ever more relevant for biotechnology as their cultivation and genetic systems improve. Some of the main advantages of archaeal cell factories are the ability to cultivate many of these often extremophilic organisms under non-sterile conditions, and to utilize inexpensive feedstocks often toxic to other microorganisms, thus drastically reducing cultivation costs. Currently, the only commercially available products of archaeal cell factories are bacterioruberin, squalene, bacteriorhodopsin and diether-/tetraether-lipids, all of which are produced utilizing halophiles. Other archaeal products, such as carotenoids and biohydrogen, as well as polyhydroxyalkanoates and methane are in early to advanced development stages, respectively.

"The malignant transformation of pulmonary epithelial cells is the result of multistep accumulation of genetic and molecular alterations highly related to tobacco carcinogens, involving key mechanisms of proliferation and apoptosis. Clonal expansion is the net result of acceleration of cell division and inhibition of active cell death (apoptosis). Oncogene activation in lung cancer (ras, myc, autocrine growth factor loops) results in acceleration of cell division. More importantly, tumor suppressor genes inactivation (p53, Rb, cyclin-dependent-kinase-Inhibitor p16) at genetic, epigenetic, or post-translational level removes important constraints on cell division at G1-check-point increasing cell proliferation. p 53 inactivation, through loss of transcription function may abrogate both G1-arrest control and apoptosis, thus accelerating clonal expansion. It is the most frequent alteration in lung cancer (70% of genetic alterations) with some differentiation dependent differences. p53 missense mutation is highly concordant with p53 stabilization and immunoreactivity. However, 20% of mutations with null phenotype (no p53 protein) provides 20% of false negative using immunohistochemistry for evaluation of p53 mutations in lung cancer. Rare situations are described with wild type p53 stabilization. p53 mutational spectrum in lung cancer reveals some specificities: 3 hot spot codons (codon 157, 248, 273) are the main target of selective adduct formation from a defined chemical carcinogen of cigarette smoke (BP). p53 stabilized mutants proteins are the targets for immune recognition in patients, leading to secretion of p53 auto-antibodies, and can also elicit T-cell specific cytotoxicity in vitro. p53 was not proven to be of prognostical importance once the tumor has developed. However, p53 stabilization is one of the best predictor of progression and irreversitiblity of preneoplastic bronchial lesion overwhelming morphological changes such as severe dysplasia. Restoration of wild type p53 function through p53 gene therapy, immunotherapy or modification of carboxy terminal end enable new therapeutic intervention. Finally, target genes and proteins situated on the downstream pathway of p53 transcription appears to be the most important factors of growth acceleration or even cell dissemination in lung cancer (Rb and its phosphorylation pathway, Bax-Bc12 balance and matrix degrading enzymes UPA and inhibitor PAI). Their constitutive deregulation could by-pass wild type p53 functions. p53 pathway offers several targets for future gene therapy or modulation in the future in lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer

Fifteen of the 30 tumors tested exhibited loss of heterozygosity/allelic imbalance (LOH/AI) at one or more loci. Chromosomal arms with frequent LOH/AI included 4q, 5p, 7p and 11p. An average of 1.1 chromosomal arms displayed LOH/AI in each individual tumor. Therefore, 4q, 5p, 7p and, to a lesser extent, 11p display significant LOH/AI in papillary thyroid cancer, which indicates the presence of putative tumor-suppressor gene loci at these chromosomal arms.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Confusion still prevails regarding the selection of patients with thyroid nodules for surgical treatment. Classical features of malignancy do not apply to growths of the thyroid gland. Duration, size, presence of calcification, scintiscanning and response to thyroid feeding are not, in themselves, reliable indicators of the absence or presence of malignancy. In 78 personal thyroidectomies there was a 60% overall neoplasm rate and a 25% malignancy rate. Operation is indicated for the thyroid lesion which is solitary, cold, unresponsive to thyroid feeding or accompanied by obvious evidence of malignancy. Recent experience indicates that thyroid surgery has a low morbidity and negligible mortality. Surgical treatment of the common forms of thyroid cancer yields excellent results if it is complete and is expertly done.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third commonest cancer in the Western world. Approximately one-quarter of cases are classified as Stage II/Dukes' B, meaning that the disease has breached the bowel wall but not spread to draining lymph nodes or distant sites. Stage II colon cancer is a heterogeneous disease both biologically and in terms of outcome. Although pivotal data have confirmed the benefit of adjuvant 5-fluorouracil (FU) chemotherapy following resection of stage II tumours the absolute reduction in risk of recurrence is small - 3 to 4 percentage points - and so most patients treated fail to gain from therapy. In contrast to stage III disease, the addition of oxaliplatin to FU as adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II disease does not improve outcome. Much attention has focused on the identification of biomarkers that identify patients more or less likely to benefit from treatment. Recent data confirm that patients with T3 primary and tumour microsatellite instability (MSI) have excellent prognosis and do not require adjuvant chemotherapy. For patients with microsatellite-stable disease, a validated recurrence score based on gene expression provides greater prognostic information than conventional clinicopathological features alone and can be used to inform discussion on the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy.",Colon_Cancer
"Active smoking remains the main cause of lung cancer. However, one must not neglect the role of occupational exposure, mainly in males and also the role of pollution. In non-smoking females of countries like China, pollution due to the use of charcoal for cooking may represent the main cause for lung cancer. Outside pollution is mainly due to combustion of fossil fuels and to diesel exhaust. Inside pollution is mainly due to environmental tobacco exposure and radon in western countries whereas in developing countries it is mainly due to cooking methods.",Lung_Cancer
"Today effective prevention of colorectal cancer can be done. For primary prevention there are good data for the recommendation of regular physical activity and body weight reduction if BMI is greater than 25 kg/m(2). Furthermore colorectal cancer risk correlates with alcohol intake and the harmful role of tobacco is well documented. But the influence of nutrition seems to be small. The results of a lot of studies are inconsistent. Diets high in fiber are recommended. The intake of red or processed meat seems to be associated with a higher risk for colorectal cancer. With the additive intake of vitamins and antioxidants the risk of colorectal cancer cannot be reduced. At present the use of drugs like aspirin, NSAD or statins cannot be recommended for primary prevention. The fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is the standard of the non-invasive screening methods. But regarding sensitivity and specificity there are better results for the new immunochemical fecal occult blood tests. The TuM2-PK test is an another screening method, but seems to be inferior to the immunochemical tests. Colonoscopy is the gold standard in the prevention of colorectal cancer. But it is important to improve the acceptance of this screening method in general population.",Colon_Cancer
We present a method for computer-generated holography based on deep learning. The inverse process of light propagation is regressed with a number of computationally generated speckle data sets.

"Isolated colonic tuberculosis (TB) is rare, and the symptoms are nonspecific making early diagnosis and management difficult. Although colonoscopy and biopsy is an important diagnostic modality, the features are variable and the distinction from other conditions of the colon, especially Crohn's disease and cancer, may be impossible without surgical resection. We report a case of ascending colon TB which was mistaken for colonic cancer during colonoscopy, with non-specific results on biopsy. The diagnosis was finally made when the histopathology report was received. The diagnostic dilemma of colonic TB is discussed.",Colon_Cancer
"Over the past decade the use of monoclonal antibodies has greatly advanced our knowledge of the biological properties and heterogeneity that exist within human tumours, and in particular in lung cancer. Early studies suggested that both the lack of specificity of individual antibodies and heterogeneity in antigenic expression would limit their widespread application in clinical practice. However, improvements in antibody selection techniques and a greater understanding of the epitopes detected with these antibodies have slowly led to the development of antibodies with improved specificity. While preliminary studies of the immunohistology of lung cancer suggest that these antibodies may be of value in histologic typing, predicting chemosensitivity and detecting bone marrow metastases, larger clinical trials are required before immunohistology becomes standard clinical practice in lung cancer studies. With such studies it is likely that the role of lung cancer immunohistology will become better defined. It is also certain through our greater understanding of lung cancer biology and heterogeneity that monoclonal antibodies will in the future play a major role in imaging diagnostic techniques, and in specific targeted therapies where antibodies directed against autocrine growth factors or their receptors, oncogene protein products, or conjugated with pharmacologic agents may replace the highly toxic, non-specific chemotherapeutic approaches of today.",Lung_Cancer
"Machine learning is proving invaluable across disciplines. However, its success is often limited by the quality and quantity of available data, while its adoption is limited by the level of trust afforded by given models. Human vs. machine performance is commonly compared empirically to decide whether a certain task should be performed by a computer or an expert. In reality, the optimal learning strategy may involve combining the complementary strengths of humans and machines. Here, we present expert-augmented machine learning (EAML), an automated method that guides the extraction of expert knowledge and its integration into machine-learned models. We used a large dataset of intensive-care patient data to derive 126 decision rules that predict hospital mortality. Using an online platform, we asked 15 clinicians to assess the relative risk of the subpopulation defined by each rule compared to the total sample. We compared the clinician-assessed risk to the empirical risk and found that, while clinicians agreed with the data in most cases, there were notable exceptions where they overestimated or underestimated the true risk. Studying the rules with greatest disagreement, we identified problems with the training data, including one miscoded variable and one hidden confounder. Filtering the rules based on the extent of disagreement between clinician-assessed risk and empirical risk, we improved performance on out-of-sample data and were able to train with less data. EAML provides a platform for automated creation of problem-specific priors, which help build robust and dependable machine-learning models in critical applications.",Generic
"Treatment of lung cancer remains frustrating. Most patients with lung cancer are not candidates for curative therapy, and new therapies have not made a substantial impact on survival. Consequently, some clinical investigators have focused their efforts on developing prevention strategies. Chemoprevention, the administration of agents to block or reverse carcinogenesis, is being investigated in ongoing trials. Studies of chemoprevention in lung cancer have included trials to reverse premalignant lesions such as sputum atypia or squamous metaplasia of the bronchial epithelium. Clinical trials of lung cancer prevention have often studied groups of participants with tobacco or asbestos exposure. Other clinical trials are being conducted among patients who have been treated for an early-stage lung cancer. As the result of diffuse epithelial injury, these patients are at very high risk for developing second primary tumors, predominantly in the lungs and upper aerodigestive tract. It is our hope that these studies may establish a new strategy for preventing lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer
"Adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer has changed significantly during the past 5 years. The traditional agent fluorouracil has been joined by new drugs, including capecitabine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and targeted agents such as bevacizumab and cetuximab. These new agents bring different mechanisms of action, different side effects, and new home care nursing implications. Significant improvements in disease-free remissions and survival rates are among the many benefits of these therapies to persons with colon cancer. This article covers these newer agents, targeted therapies for colon cancer, and associated nursing and patient implications, including detailed drug information.",Colon_Cancer
"Chemotherapy is currently a primary treatment modality for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Combination chemotherapy of anticancer agents improves survival and mortality rather than chemotherapy with single agent. On the other hand, the role of chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) is still controversial. Several meta-analysis demonstrated a small but significant survival benefit of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. In the limited stage SCLC and locally advanced NSCLC, a combination of chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation was found to be superior to chemotherapy alone by several randomized trials and meta-analysis. Concurrent administration of anticancer agents with thoracic irradiation may be optimal treatment. In the last few years, several new agents have demonstrated antitumor activity against lung cancer and randomized trials of these drugs are now under way.",Lung_Cancer
"Aberrant DNA methylation has a specific role in field cancerization. Certain molecular markers, including secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2), tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2 ), N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 4 (NDRG4) and bone morphogenic protein 3 (BMP3), have previously been shown to be hypermethylated in colorectal cancer (CRC).

"The RET (rearranged during transfection) protooncogene encodes a single pass transmembrane receptor that is expressed in cells derived from the neural crest and the urogenital tract. As part of a cell-surface complex, RET binds glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligands in conjunction with GDNF-family alpha co-receptors (GFRalpha). Ligand-induced activation induces dimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation of the RET receptor with downstream activation of several signal transduction pathways. Activating germline RET mutations play a central role in the development of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and also in the development of the congenital abnormality Hirschsprung's disease. Approximately 50% of patients with sporadic MTC have somatic RET mutations, and a significant portion of papillary thyroid carcinomas result from chromosomal inversions or translocations, which activate RET (RET/PTC oncogenes). The RET protooncogene has a significant place in cancer prevention and treatment. Timely thyroidectomy in kindred members who have inherited a mutated RET allele, characteristic of MEN2A, MEN2B, or FMTC, can prevent MTC, the most common cause of death in these syndromes. Also, recently developed molecular therapeutics that target the RET pathway have shown activity in clinical trials of patients with advanced MTC, a disease for which there has been no effective therapy.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Radon exposure is the second leading cause of lung cancer, following tobacco smoke. Radon is not only an independent risk factor; it also increases the risk of lung cancer in smokers. Numerous cohort, case-control, and experimental studies have established the carcinogenic potential of radon. The possibility of radon having a causative effect on other cancers has been explored but not yet proven. One of the postulated mechanisms of carcinogenesis is DNA damage by alpha particles mediated by the production of reactive oxygen species. The latter are also thought to constitute one of the common mechanisms underlying the synergistic effect of radon and tobacco smoke. With an estimated 21,000 lung cancer deaths attributable to radon in the United States annually, the need for radon mitigation is well acknowledged. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established an indoor limit of 4 picocuries (pCi)/L, and various methods are available for indoor radon reduction when testing shows higher levels. Radon mitigation should accompany smoking cessation measures in lung cancer prevention efforts.",Lung_Cancer
"The goal of improving adjuvant treatment can be reached in two ways: firstly, by developing more effective drugs and protocols and, secondly, by selecting suitable patients on the basis of clinical and molecular factors. In UICC (Union internationale contre le cancer) stage II, microsatellite instability (MSI) is a strong prognostic factor. Whether it can also be used as a predictive marker is currently a matter of controversy because the available data are contradictory. The question whether or not the MSI status should be checked before treatment decisions are made in stage II patients can therefore not be clearly answered at present. For adjuvant treatment in stage III, with capecitabine/oxaliplatin (XELOX) there is now a new protocol available that is based on the orally administered prodrug capecitabine. With regard to the question of how much older patients in this stage may also benefit from a combination chemotherapy, new--and contradictory--data have emerged recently: firstly, preliminary results of two new studies have given rise to safety concerns and, secondly, an analysis by the 'ACCENT Collaborative Group' indicated lower efficacy of the 'newer' adjuvant protocols in older people. These findings, however, have now been called into question as a result of a new subgroup analysis from the XELOXA study. The expert group therefore recommended that the decision whether to treat patients older than 70 years with an (oral) fluoropyrimidine alone or in combination with oxaliplatin should be based on clinical parameters such as biological age and comorbidities.",Colon_Cancer
"Standardization of colon cancer surgery has been one of the hottest issues for to clinicians. The establishment of complete mesocolic excision (CME) concept standardizes and defines the anatomic access of surgical procedures of colon cancer, and also provides the possibility to obtain high quality standards of pathological specimen assessment. In 2010 the Ministry of Health announced Standard of Diagnosis and Treatment of Colorectal Cancer on the legal basis. However, hot discussion was present again,due to the lack of definition of standardized operation. Through reviewing Japanese Standard of Diagnosis and Treatment of Colon Cancer (7th Edition), and the literature on CME published in English and Chinese since April 2009, the authors raise the discussion and reflection on theoretical basis that the safe bowel resection margin must be reached in colon cancer RO surgery and rationality of regional lymph node dissection.",Colon_Cancer
"Many isotopes are available for imaging patients with suspected thyroid cancer recurrence and metastases. TSH-stimulated low-dose 131I whole-body scanning with serum thyroglobulin either by standard LT4 withdrawal or rhTSH stimulation is the preferred test for monitoring patients without palpable disease or elevated serum thyroglobulin on LT4 therapy (Fig. 5). This approach has the advantage of finding disease that may be amenable to 131I therapy, although low-dose 131I scans are less sensitive than are scans with other imaging agents. 123I has better imaging characteristics than 131I and has been shown to be equivalent or superior to low-dose 131I in recent studies. As the availability of 123I increases and the cost decreases, this agent may replace 131I in imaging for recurrent or metastatic thyroid cancer. Patients who have an elevated serum thyroglobulin on LT4 therapy or after TSH stimulation but have a negative low-dose 131I scan require other imaging procedures to find the suspected disease. The authors currently perform a sensitive neck ultrasound to look for surgically remediable disease and consider a noncontrast CT scan of the chest to look for small pulmonary metastases that poorly concentrate low doses of 131I (Fig. 5). Fluoro-18-deoxyglucose PET, 99mTc MIBI, 201Tl, and 99mTc tetrofosmin are primarily useful in the setting of a negative whole-body 131I scan and elevated serum thyroglobulin. 18FDG-PET seems to have the highest sensitivity in this setting and would be the preferred imaging agent, but availability and cost are major issues (Fig. 5). Although some researchers have advocated these radiopharmaceuticals as first-line agents replacing 131I, there is little support for this position. This approach to imaging is not cost-effective because positive scans in these patients would most likely require 131I scintigraphy to determine whether the lesions are amenable to radioiodine therapy. 99mTc pertechnetate, 99mTc furifosmin, and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy have a limited role in imaging for recurrent or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma. In choosing among 99mTc MIBI, 201Tl, and 99mTc tetrofosmin, the technetium label of sestamibi and tetrofosmin results in better image quality and faster imaging than 201Tl. Although 99mTc sestamibi and 99mTc tetrofosmin have not been compared in a large series, the higher tumor-to-background ratio and consistently high sensitivities of 99mTc tetrofosmin suggest that it could potentially have additional value over 99mTc sestamibi, but there is still limited experience with 99mTc tetrofosmin.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Primary lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the world. Thorough clinical staging of patients with lung cancer is important, because therapeutic options and management are to a considerable degree dependent on stage at presentation. Radiologic imaging is an essential component of clinical staging, including chest radiography in some cases, computed tomography, MRI, and PET.

"Colorectal cancer is one of the most frequent cancers in the world, especially in occidental countries. The primary curative therapy is surgical resection of the tumour. Within the last 15 years, appropriately powered prospective randomized trials have demonstrated that adjuvant post-operative chemotherapy should be the standard treatment for stage III cancers (node-positive disease). 5-Fluorouracil(5FU)/levamisole was used in the early 1990s but has now been replaced by 5FU/leucovorin. The recommended duration of treatment is 6 months. Combining levamisole with 5FU/leucovorin does not improve efficacy. In patients with stage II colon cancer it is still unclear whether adjuvant chemotherapy is effective. In an attempt to define groups of stage II cases that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, considerable efforts have been made to determine molecular genetic factors (tumour-ploidy and mutations or alterations in oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes). Regional therapy (particularly portal vein infusion) is one of the other therapeutic strategies still considered to be investigational. Current clinical trials are evaluating the role of non-fluorinated pyrimidine agents in an adjuvant setting.",Colon_Cancer
"Colorectal cancer appears to have rapidly increased over the past two decades in Korea. Environmental factors, characterized by a western life style, seem to be closely related to the increased risk of colorectal cancer. Higher intakes of meat, a lower vegetable intake, a lack of physical activity, obesity, and alcohol drinking have been suggested to be risk factors for colorectal cancer in the numerous epidemiologic studies. Several specific associations have also been observed between genetic polymorphisms and colorectal cancer. Moreover, it has been postulated that environmental factors and a genetic predisposition work in concert in colorectal cancer development. A stronger association between red meat intake and colorectal cancer among those with rapid acetylators at either the NAT1 or NAT2 locus was reported, particularly for colorectal cancer associated with K-ras mutations. The protective effect of the homozygous variant TT form of the MTHFR genotype on the risk of colon cancer seems to be modified by the level of methyl diets, i.e., by folate, which has a protective effect, or conversely by alcohol. The insulin-related pathway, which possibly explains at a mechanistic level the effect of physical activity and obesity on colon cancer, appears to be a common denominator in colon cancer and in other metabolic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. Hyperinsulinemia has been proposed as an explanation for the association between a Western lifestyle and colon cancer risk. Further studies, that incorporate both genetic and environmental factors, are needed to fully explain and identify the underlying pathway of colorectal carcinogenesis.",Colon_Cancer

"As a single agent, irinotecan has demonstrated efficacy in metastatic 5FU resistant colorectal metastatic cancer. Chemotherapy with fluorouracil (5FU) plus leucovorin remains a standard in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. It seemed logical to test the combination of this reference treatment and the new agent. The first trials gave rather disappointing results, suggesting an inhibition of the metabolism of irinotecan into SN38 when 5FU was present in the circulation. More recent studies have given totally different results with a very good tolerance and strong efficacy of the combination of weekly folinic acid + 5FU and irinotecan or LV5FU2 (the so-called de Gramont regimen) and irinotecan. The results were so good that these new schedules are currently developed as first line regimen. Another way to combine 5FU, folinic acid and irinotecan is to alternate a cycle of 5FU, folinic acid and a cycle of irinotecan. Such an alternated schedule has given encouraging results with an objective response rate greater than 30% and a long median survival time (more than 16 months). It is also very easy to combine irinotecan with other drug which have demonstrated activity in the treatment of colorectal cancer. The combinations of irinotecan and mitomycin C or oxaliplatin have given very good results with high objective response rates and good tolerance. Irinotecan plays now an important part in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. This part becomes larger due to the results of the combination trials already presented which have shown strong efficacy and good tolerance.",Colon_Cancer
"Increased aerobic glycolysis portends an unfavorable prognosis in thyroid cancer. The metabolic reprogramming likely results from altered mitochondrial activity and may promote cancer progression. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1 (PGC1 ) plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial biogenesis and function. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the clinicopathological significance of PGC1 expression and the potential effects of PGC1 modulation. Firstly, the expression of PGC1 in thyroid cancer samples was evaluated using western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining. Compared with normal thyroid tissue, PGC1 expression was downregulated in thyroid cancer. PGC1 -negative papillary cancer was associated with BRAF V600E mutation, large tumor size, extrathyroidal or lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, and advanced stage. The results were consistent with the analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data. PGC1 expression correlated with oxygen consumption in thyroid cancer cells and was inversely related to AKT activity. The biologic relevance of PGC1 was further investigated by gain- and loss-of-function experimental studies. PGC1 overexpression led to augmented oxidative metabolism and accelerated tumor growth, whereas PGC1 knockdown induced a glycolytic phenotype but reduced tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, PGC1 downregulation is associated with glycolytic metabolism and advanced disease in thyroid cancer. Nonetheless, manipulating PGC1 expression and metabolic phenotype does not necessarily translate into beneficial effects. It suggests that the metabolic phenotype is likely the consequence rather than the cause of disease progression in thyroid cancer.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Lung cancer screening with CT remains controversial. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. To date, no screening test has been demonstrated to reduce mortality. Given the large population of adult cigarette smokers and former smokers worldwide, there is a large population at risk for lung cancer. While a lot has been learned from prospective single-arm cohort studies about the feasibility of performing annual CT to screen for lung cancer, many questions have also been raised. While we know that screening for lung cancer with CT detects many small nodules, with up to half the subjects having a positive baseline screen, and up to 75% of subjects having a positive screen at least once if screened annually for 5 years, the great majority of these nodules exhibit benign biologic behavior. The innumerable small nodules detected with screening CT, and diagnostic chest CT in general, present a daily clinical challenge, and result in extensive medical resource utilization and additional radiation exposure. Algorithms for how and when to follow small nodules detected on CT are in evolution. Ongoing studies are designed to determine if lung cancer screening with CT reduces lung cancer mortality.",Lung_Cancer
"Lung cancer is in epidemic proportions throughout the world. It is imperative that a simple, accurate staging system be used to direct treatment and evaluate its effects on long-term survival.

"A rare case of a papillary thyroid cancer in a young boy is reported. At the age of 8 years a rapidly growing tumour of the right antero-lateral neck region was detected. Biopsy revealed a cervical lymph node metastasis of a papillary thyroid carcinoma. Any adequate therapy was rejected by the patient's father. After two years of delay, at the age of ten, a severe dyspnoea urged to an emergency tracheotomy. The further investigations revealed a bilateral partly papillary, partly follicular and partly anaplastic thyroid carcinoma with infiltration and compression of the cervical trachea and the cricoid and with right recurrent nerve paralysis. The thyroid cancer was classified as T3N2bM0. To save the boy's life an extensive operation was performed with total extirpation of the thyroid gland and the adjacent tissues, total laryngectomy and resection of the cervical trachea, combined with bilateral neck dissection. The patient has been given no other treatment than hormone substitution during 16 years after surgery. The patient grew up normally and stayed recurrence-free.

"Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system, the papillary variant accounts for 80-90% of all diagnosed cases. In the development of papillary thyroid cancer, BRAF and RAS genes are mainly affected, resulting in a modification of the system of intracellular signaling proteins known as protein kinase mitogen-activated (MAPK) which consist of modules of internal signaling proteins (Receptor/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK) from the cell membrane to the nucleus. In thyroid cancer, these signanling proteins regulate diverse cellular processes such as differentiation, growth, development and apoptosis. MAPK play an important role in the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer as they are used as molecular biomarkers for diagnostic, prognostic and as possible therapeutic molecular targets. Mutations in BRAF gene have been correlated with poor response to treatment with traditional chemotherapy and as an indicator of poor prognosis.",Thyroid_Cancer
"In 1996, the authors were asked to review the subject of thyroid cancer in children. Over the subsequent decade, much has been learned about the treatment and outcome of these uncommon tumors. We now recognize quantitative and perhaps qualitative differences in genetic mutations and growth factor expression patterns in childhood thyroid cancers compared with those of adults. We also know that thyroid cancers induce a robust immune response in children that might contribute to their longevity. Patients under 10 years of age probably represent a unique subset of children at particularly high risk for persistent or recurrent disease; the management of these patients is under evaluation. We remain limited in our knowledge of how to stratify children into low- and high-risk categories for appropriate long-term follow-up and in our knowledge of how to treat children who have detectable serum thyroglobulin but negative imaging studies.

We present a review of the current knowledge on cellular metabolism in non-cancerous and cancerous thyroid tissues, focusing on the monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT4, and on a transporter of the outer mitochondrial membrane TOMM20. Understanding the metabolic phenotype of tumor cells and associated stromal cells in thyroid cancer can have profound implications on the use of biomarker staining in detecting subclinical cancer, imaging as it relates to expression of various transport proteins, and therapeutic interventions that manipulate this dysregulated tumor metabolism to halt tumorigenesis and eradicate the cancer.

Several oncogenic pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of MTC including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, MET, and most importantly RET, and the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors vandetanib and cabozantinib have been approved for advanced MTC based on data from phase III studies. As activating RET mutations represent the most important driver, specific RET inhibitors were introduced and suggest high response rates with limited off-target toxicities. The current review provides a practical overview on clinical presentation and management from early to advanced MTC.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Microscopic examination of stained smears and tissue sections remains the standard method for definitive diagnosis and classification of lung cancer. However, the morphology of lung cancer is complex, and consensus classifications such as those prepared by a panel World Health Organization (WHO) are required for the sake of consistency and clinical relevance. In the most recent (1999) WHO classification, the diagnostic categories of greatest clinical importance, small cell lung carcinoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma, remain fundamentally unchanged. However, application of immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy has revealed expression of neuroendocrine markers in a wide variety of tumors. Expression of these markers is not taken into account in current treatment protocols, and additional correlative studies will be required to determine the clinical relevance of neuroendocrine differentiation in lung carcinoma. In addition to histological classification, microscopic analysis can provide in situ evidence of response to chemotherapy, as well as information on precursor lesions and multistep carcinogenesis in the airways. Finally, it is likely that morphological assessment of lung carcinoma and preneoplastic lesions will continue to be refined as new diagnostic modalities such as spiral computed tomography and fluorescence bronchoscopy provide previously inaccessible specimens for morphological and correlative molecular studies.",Lung_Cancer

"Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world, and smoking is the major risk factor, accounting for about 90% of the cases. Diet has also been implicated in the development of lung cancer, although the specific nutrients remain to be elucidated. Vitamins with antioxidant activity have received much attention. beta-Carotene, the most efficient provitamin A, was found to be inversely related to the risk of lung cancer in many prospective epidemiological studies, especially in studies measuring serum concentrations of beta-carotene. The findings from controlled trials, however, contradict the hypothesis that beta-carotene could prevent lung cancer, but rather suggest increased risk of lung cancer with supplementary beta-carotene. Data from both prospective studies and a controlled trial suggest no role for vitamin E in lung carcinogenesis. Some prospective epidemiological studies suggest an inverse relationship between dietary vitamin C and the risk of lung cancer, but due to the high correlation between dietary vitamin C and vegetable and fruit intake the independent role of dietary vitamin C is difficult to estimate. Studies using prediagnostic plasma concentrations of ascorbic acid do not support the involvement of vitamin C in lung carcinogenesis, and no controlled trials of vitamin C on lung cancer have been published. Thus, supplementation with antioxidant vitamins cannot be recommended for the prevention of lung cancer. Non-smoking is the most important target in the prevention of lung cancer. High intakes of vegetables and fruits may provide additional protection and are unlikely to be harmful.",Lung_Cancer
"Although lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among men and women in the United States, female smokers appear to be at increased risk. After controlling for the number of cigarettes smoked, female sex imparts a significant, independent risk for most histologic types of lung cancer. Cigarette smoking, genetics, and endocrine factors may interact to contribute to the disparity in lung cancer risk between the sexes. Estrogens have direct and indirect actions in the lung, and estrogen has been implicated in lung carcinogenesis in female smokers. This review of the literature will focus on endocrine factors and tobacco carcinogens as risk factors for lung cancer in women.",Lung_Cancer
"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare but very aggressive form of undifferentiated thyroid cancer. Due to its rapid rate of progression and invasive nature, ATC poses significant risks of morbidity and mortality. The cornerstone in the management of ATC remains a prompt diagnosis of the disease and timely management of complications depending on the stage of disease. Surgery continues to offer a higher chance of a cure, although not all patients are candidates for surgical management. Patients with advanced disease may be considered for palliative surgery to reduce morbidity and complications from advanced disease. With the advent of new molecular testing and improved methods of diagnosis, novel therapeutic targets have been identified. Systemic therapy (chemotherapy and radiation therapy) as well as novel immunotherapy have shown some promise in patients with targetable genetic mutations. Patients should therefore have molecular testing of their tumor-if it is unresectable-and be tested for mutations that are targetable. Mutation-targeted therapy may be effective and may result in a significant response to allow surgical intervention for exceptional responders. Overall, patients who receive all three modalities of therapy (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy) have the highest overall survival.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Differentiated thyroid cancer has a good overall prognosis, however, unfavourable evolution may be observed in cases discovered at an advanced stage. Thyroid cancer incidence has increased in occidental countries over the last 20 years without any significant change in mortality. This has been partially related to changes in diagnostic procedures with an increased detection of small cancers. Indeed, microcarcinomas (less than 10mm diameter), frequently incidentally discovered are now, the most frequent form of thyroid cancer, representing around 40 % of cases. Their prognosis is excellent and the benefit of their surgical management remains to be demonstrated. Unexpectedly, the proportion of large thyroid cancer at diagnosis has remained stable representing around 20 % of cases. These forms are responsible of most of the thyroid cancer specific mortality and an intensification of their clinical screening is necessary. By contrast, a systematic ultrasonographic screening of thyroid nodules should increase the proportion of small thyroid cancers without evidence of an earlier diagnosis of advanced forms and the ratio cost-benefit of such a strategy should be properly evaluated.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Recent improvements in serum Tg assays, the availability of recombinant thyrotropin, widespread use of neck ultrasonography, and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT have caused a shift of paradigm in the detection of recurrent disease in well differentiated thyroid cancer.

"Extended lymphadenectomy has gained considerable attention as an adjunct to conventional colon cancer surgery with the hope that it may potentially decrease local recurrence rates and improve cancer-specific outcome measures. Despite the enthusiasm surrounding these techniques, it is difficult to establish any additional survival benefit associated with more comprehensive lymphadenectomy strategies when these are performed in addition to conventional colon cancer surgery. Furthermore, these techniques remain unproven by large randomized clinical trials. The appropriate indications for performing extended lymphadenectomy also remain unclear, and there is a lack of standardization with regard to surgical technique. Moreover, there are a number of confounding factors that frequently receive little attention when oncological outcome measures are reported following extended lymphadenectomy in the setting of colon cancer. The purpose of this review is to outline these confounding issues and discuss their impact on reports describing cancer-specific outcome measures following the use of extended lymphadenectomy techniques. Furthermore, this review proposes that in light of the available published evidence, the role of radical lymphadenectomy is currently unproven, with large randomized clinical trials required in the future to determine whether there is a survival benefit for colon cancer patients.",Colon_Cancer
"Anaplastic thyroid cancer is an uncommon, typically lethal malignancy of older adults with no effective systemic therapy. The mean survival time is usually less than 6 months from the time of diagnosis and, unfortunately, this outcome is not fundamentally altered by available treatments. Histologic tissue confirmation is recommended if the diagnosis is not absolutely certain to exclude tumors with better prognosis or that require different treatment. Patency of the airway should be kept in mind throughout the patient's course and individuals with impending airway obstruction, in the absence of imminent death from other sites of disease, should be considered for a tracheostomy to secure the airway. Enrollment in meaningful clinical trials should be given the highest priority at all decision points.",Thyroid_Cancer
"MicroRNAs are being exploited for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of cancer and other diseases. Their high tissue specificity and critical role in oncogenesis provide new biomarkers for the diagnosis and classification of cancer as well as predicting patients' outcomes. MicroRNAs signatures have been identified for many human tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC). In most cases, metastatic disease is difficult to predict and to prevent with adequate therapies. The aim of our study was to identify a microRNA signature for metastatic CRC that could predict and differentiate metastatic target organ localization. Normal and cancer tissues of three different groups of CRC patients were analyzed. RNA microarray and TaqMan Array analysis were performed on 66 Italian patients with or without lymph nodes and/or liver recurrences. Data obtained with the two assays were analyzed separately and then intersected to identify a primary CRC metastatic signature. Five differentially expressed microRNAs (hsa-miR-21, -103, -93, -31 and -566) were validated by qRT-PCR on a second group of 16 American metastatic patients. In situ hybridization was performed on the 16 American patients as well as on three distinct commercial tissues microarray (TMA) containing normal adjacent colon, the primary adenocarcinoma, normal and metastatic lymph nodes and liver. Hsa-miRNA-21, -93, and -103 upregulation together with hsa-miR-566 downregulation defined the CRC metastatic signature, while in situ hybridization data identified a lymphonodal invasion profile. We provided the first microRNAs signature that could discriminate between colorectal recurrences to lymph nodes and liver and between colorectal liver metastasis and primary hepatic tumor.",Colon_Cancer

"Nonmedullary thyroid cancer (NMTC) can be sporadic or can occur as a component cancer as part of several well-described hereditary cancer syndromes. NMTC, particularly papillary thyroid cancer, also can occur by itself in families and is often termed familial NMTC or familial papillary thyroid cancer. The occurrence of NMTC in families, along with extensive population-based evidence from patients with sporadic thyroid cancer, together suggest that NMTC has a strong genetic component, only a small proportion of which has been characterized to date. Advances in genetic and genomic technology have rapidly advanced our understanding of the complex nature of NMTC susceptibility, although much remains to be explained. Herein, we describe the current state of knowledge, starting with a brief review of hereditary syndromic causes and moving on to describe recent data using modern genomic approaches to identifying genes involved in the predisposition to NMTC.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Ultrasound (US), a exible green imaging modality, is expanding globally as a rst-line imaging technique in various clinical fields following with the continual emergence of advanced ultrasonic technologies and the well-established US-based digital health system.

"Gene therapy was originally conceived to treat monogenic diseases. The replacement of a defective gene with a functional gene can theoretically cure the disease. In cancer, multiple genetic defects are present and the molecular profile changes during the course of the disease, making the replacement of all defective genes impossible. To overcome these difficulties, various gene therapy strategies have been adopted, including immune stimulation, transfer of suicide genes, inhibition of driver oncogenes, replacement of tumor-suppressor genes that could mediate apoptosis or anti-angiogenesis, and transfer of genes that enhance conventional treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Some of these strategies have been tested successfully in non-small-cell lung cancer patients and the results of laboratory studies and clinical trials are reviewed herein.",Lung_Cancer
"The most active vitamin D metabolite, 1 ,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)), is a pleiotropic hormone with wide regulatory actions. Classically, vitamin D deficiency was known to alter calcium and phosphate metabolism and bone biology. In addition, recent epidemiological and experimental studies support the association of vitamin D deficiency with a large variety of human diseases, and particularly with the high risk of colorectal cancer. By regulating the expression of many genes via several mechanisms, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induces differentiation, controls the detoxification metabolism and cell phenotype, sensitises cells to apoptosis and inhibits the proliferation of cultured human colon carcinoma cells. Consistently, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and several of its analogues decrease intestinal tumourigenesis in animal models. Molecular, genetic and clinical data in humans are scarce but they suggest that vitamin D is protective against colon cancer. Clearly, the available evidence warrants new, well-designed, large-scale trials to clarify the role of vitamin D in the prevention and/or therapy of this important neoplasia.",Colon_Cancer
"Most chemical carcinogens are metabolized and activated in vivo by phase I enzymes including the microsomal cytochromes P450 and epoxide hydroxylases. The carcinogens and their metabolites are detoxified by phase II enzymes that in clude various transferases such as glutathion-S-transferases (GST). Increasing numbers of studies have demonstrated the association of the polymorphisms inGSTM1 (a member of GST) andCYP1A1 genes with the susceptibility to lung cancer. Subsequently, the polymorphisms appear to be important biomarkers that provide information for assessment of exposure and total burden of environmental carcinogens. Therefore, the investigation of the polymorphisms in these genes will provide information not only for the prediction of individual cancer risk but also for the prevention of cancer. In this review, we will summarize the polymorphisms in theGSTM1 andCYP1A1 genes and their relation to lung cancer susceptibility.",Lung_Cancer
"This articles aims to review epidemiological aspects related to lung cancer (LC). The risk factors for LC are external factors and host factors. One can note an increasing incidence of LC in women, related to considerable increase of smoking habits in this group. Mortality by LC is related to number of cigarettes smoked daily and how deep the smoke is inhaled. Air pollution and occupational factors increase the LC risk among industrial workers. Pre-existing lung diseases (pulmonary fibrosis, COPD or bronchial asthma) can increase the risk for LC. There are also genetic factors involved in LC. Carcinogenesis is a multi-stage process. In each stage exogenous and endogenous factors are involved, determining mutations on the dominant oncogenes and on genes suppressing tumor appearance.",Lung_Cancer
"Over the past few years, evidence has accumulated indicating that apart from genetic alterations, epigenetic alterations, through e.g. aberrant promoter methylation, play a major role in the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Even in the hereditary colon cancer syndromes, in which the susceptibility is inherited dominantly, cancer develops only as the result of the progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations. Diet can both prevent and induce colon carcinogenesis, for instance, through epigenetic changes, which regulate the homeostasis of the intestinal mucosa. Food-derived compounds are constantly present in the intestine and may shift cellular balance toward harmful outcomes, such as increased susceptibility to mutations. There is strong evidence that a major component of cancer risk may involve epigenetic changes in normal cells that increase the probability of cancer after genetic mutation. The recognition of epigenetic changes as a driving force in colorectal neoplasia would open new areas of research in disease epidemiology, risk assessment, and treatment, especially in mutation carriers who already have an inherited predisposition to cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Cell growth and proliferation are controlled through different posttranslational modifications including demethylation, a process regulated by regulated by the demethylase enzymes. This review focuses on our current understanding of functional and therapeutic potentials of histone demethylases in colon cancer.

"Colon cancer is associated with a family history in up to 25% of cases. As many as 5% are associated with an established hereditary syndrome, demonstrating the profound influence of inheritable genetic mechanisms in the development of this disease. These syndromes confer a diverse spectrum of risk, age of presentation, endoscopic and histological findings, extracolonic manifestations, and modes of inheritance. As the molecular characteristics of these disorders become better described, enhanced genotype-phenotype correlations may offer a more targeted approach to diagnosis, screening, and surveillance. While the strategies for diagnosis and management of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome are more established, the approach to newly recognized syndromes such as MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) and hyperplastic polyposis syndromes continues to evolve.

"We report our experience of the presentation and management of symptomatic hypercalcaemia in advanced lung cancer. Between 1981 and 1987, 55 patients required urgent admission due to rapid clinical deterioration accompanied by significant hypercalcaemia (greater than 2.75 mmol l-1). Forty patients (72%) had squamous cell cancer, five small cell, three large cell, two adenocarcinoma and five unclassified. Thirty-five had evidence of bony metastases. Symptoms were categorized for each patient on the basis of being either potentially attributable to hypercalcaemia or not. All patients were rehydrated but specific treatment schedules over the period varied [1981-1985: steroids, calcitonin, mithramycin; 1985-1987: aminohydroxypropylidene bisphosphonate (APD)]. Treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the prevalence of all systems except for pain and nausea/vomiting; the greatest effect being seen on central nervous system and renal tract symptoms (75 and 80% reduction respectively; P less than 0.005 pre- versus post-treatment). Overall, 45 patients (82%) had a biochemical response; serum calcium fell from 3.28 +/- 0.33 mmol l-1 (mean +/- SE) to a nadir of 2.54 +/- 0.36 mmol l-1 (P less than 0.001).

"Gastrin is trophic for normal gastric and colonic mucosa. We examined the potential trophic effects of chronic gastrin administration on the growth of mouse colon adenocarcinoma (MC-26). Thirty-three mice bearing transplantable MC-26 colon cancers were treated with varying doses (125, 250, or 500 micrograms/kg/day) of pentagastrin. Significant increases in tumor weight and DNA content were observed. Fundic mucosal weight and DNA content in these mice showed a dose-related trophic response. The weight of control fundic mucosa was 10 mg and rose to 20, 45, and 65 mg with increasing doses of gastrin. The DNA content of control fundic mucosa was 155 micrograms and rose to 220, 340, and 480 micrograms as the dose of gastrin was increased. Pentagastrin stimulated growth of the MC-26 colon cancer, but the threshold for gastrin-stimulated tumor growth was different from that of normal mucosal growth. The hyperplastic response of the fundic mucosa was increased by increasing gastrin doses; whereas, colon cancer hyperplasia was maximal at the lowest dose tested (125 micrograms/kg/day) and did not increase further with increasing doses of hormone. Mice bearing gastrin-stimulated tumors died at a significantly greater rate than did mice with untreated tumors (80% of control mice and none of the treated mice were alive at day 55). The effects of gastrin treatment on the growth of MC-26 colon cancer persist after treatment is discontinued; mice with tumors that were treated with gastrin for either 7 or 14 days and in which the treatment was stopped were all dead by 35 or 28 days, respectively, after the end of treatment.",Colon_Cancer

Interpretation of serum Tg requires knowledge of the concurrent thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration, as secretion is TSH dependant, and an awareness of the limitations of the methods used to measure it. These limitations include the heterogeneity of Tg in serum, the ability of assays to recognise forms of Tg secreted by a tumour, assay biases and not least the potential for interference in immunoassays for Tg from endogenous thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs) in patient serum. This review considers what the clinician wants to know and how Tg results can be interpreted in light of an awareness of assay limitations.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Radiology artificial intelligence (AI) projects involve the integration of integrating numerous medical devices, wireless technologies, data warehouses, and social networks. While cybersecurity threats are not new to healthcare, their prevalence has increased with the rise of AI research for applications in radiology, making them one of the major healthcare risks of 2021. Radiologists have extensive experience with the interpretation of medical imaging data but radiologists may not have the required level of awareness or training related to AI-specific cybersecurity concerns. Healthcare providers and device manufacturers can learn from other industry sector industries that have already taken steps to improve their cybersecurity systems. This review aims to introduce cybersecurity concepts as it relates to medical imaging and to provide background information on general and healthcare-specific cybersecurity challenges. We discuss approaches to enhancing the level and effectiveness of security through detection and prevention techniques, as well as ways that technology can improve security while mitigating risks. We first review general cybersecurity concepts and regulatory issues before examining these topics in the context of radiology AI, with a specific focus on data, training, data, training, implementation, and auditability. Finally, we suggest potential risk mitigation strategies. By reading this review, healthcare providers, researchers, and device developers can gain a better understanding of the potential risks associated with radiology AI projects, as well as strategies to improve cybersecurity and reduce potential associated risks. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: This review can aid radiologists' and related professionals' understanding of the potential cybersecurity risks associated with radiology AI projects, as well as strategies to improve security. KEY POINTS: Embarking on a radiology artificial intelligence (AI) project is complex and not without risk especially as cybersecurity threats have certainly become more abundant in the healthcare industry. Fortunately healthcare providers and device manufacturers have the advantage of being able to take inspiration from other industry sectors who are leading the way in the field. Herein we provide an introduction to cybersecurity as it pertains to radiology, a background to both general and healthcare-specific cybersecurity challenges; we outline general approaches to improving security through both detection and preventative techniques, and instances where technology can increase security while mitigating risks.",Generic

"Lung cancer is one of the most incident types of cancer and a leading cause of cancer mortality in Brazil. We reviewed the current status of lung cancer by searching relevant data on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in the country. This review highlights several issues that need to be addressed, including smoking control, patient lack of awareness, late diagnosis, and disparities in the access to cancer health care facilities in Brazil. We propose strategies to help overcome these limitations and challenge health care providers, as well as the society and governmental representatives, to work together and to take a step forward in fighting lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer
"No one doubts that lymph node dissection in colon cancer is necessary, it is just the extent of that dissection that is still under debate. As the individual steps of an oncologic operation cannot be separated from each other, analysis of the significance of lymph node dissection alone is difficult. It has been proven that the T category is directly related to the number and central spread of lymph node metastases. Micrometastases and isolated tumor cells may be detected in lymph nodes by using special staining techniques; their presence may worsen prognosis significantly and approximate it to UICC stage III. The numbers of dissected lymph nodes and the ratio of involved versus dissected lymph nodes have been used as markers for quality of surgery and histopathological evaluation. Recent results underscore the importance of technique and extent of dissection. Dissection must be performed along the embryologic planes of the mesocolon and leave them intact. A high vascular tie with preservation of the central hypogastric nerves must be applied in order to achieve the best oncologic results while preserving quality of life. Extended lymphadenectomy is oncologically relevant only when it is combined with removal of the primary tumor with adequate longitudinal clearance, an intact complete mesocolon, and high vascular tie. It is part of a concept in which the tumor-bearing specimen is harvested as an enveloped package to minimize the risk of tumor cell spillage and local recurrence.",Colon_Cancer
"Selenocysteine-containing proteins (selenoproteins) have been implicated in the regulation of various cell signaling pathways, many of which are linked to colorectal malignancies. In this in-depth excurse into the selenoprotein literature, we review possible roles for human selenoproteins in colorectal cancer, focusing on the typical hallmarks of cancer cells and their tumor-enabling characteristics. Human genome studies of single nucleotide polymorphisms in various genes coding for selenoproteins have revealed potential involvement of glutathione peroxidases, thioredoxin reductases, and other proteins. Cell culture studies with targeted down-regulation of selenoproteins and studies utilizing knockout/transgenic animal models have helped elucidate the potential roles of individual selenoproteins in this malignancy. Those selenoproteins, for which strong links to development or progression of colorectal cancer have been described, may be potential future targets for clinical interventions.",Colon_Cancer

"A growing body of evidence supports the central role of platelets in early events of tumorigenesis and metastasis. Activated platelets, in response to tissue damage, induce a proinflammatory program involving the aberrant expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, which leads to increased tissue concentrations of the proinflammatory and protumorigenic prostaglandin E2. The central role of platelet activation in cancer development is sustained by the analysis of clinical studies with aspirin showing an anti-cancer efficacy by the drug, even at the low doses used for the prevention of atherothrombosis. Low-dose aspirin acts as an antiplatelet agent by causing an irreversible inactivation of platelet COX-1 activity and the synthesis of thromboxane A2. Further experimental and clinical studies are ongoing to confirm the central role of platelets in the development of inflammation and cancer. The corroboration of this hypothesis will open new opportunities for the prevention and treatment of cancer. In addition to the possible use of traditional antithrombotic agents, the recent identification of novel molecular determinants involved in the cross-talk between platelets and other cellular player of tumorigenesis and metastasis has led to the suggestion of novel therapeutic strategies in oncology.",Colon_Cancer

"Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in Iceland and the most frequent cause of cancer related deaths. Smoking is by far the most important cause but familial factors also contribute. The symptoms of lung cancer are often subtle and the diagnosis, in about 70% of cases, is made when metastases have occurred. Curative surgical treatment is therefore only possible in about a third of the cases whereas other patients receive chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. In recent years some important advances have been made in the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to lung cancer. New imaging techniques have improved diagnosis and staging practices and consequently also treatment. Recent evidence suggests that screening with low dose CT may improve survival. New approaches to chemotherapy have been shown to improve survival and well being of patients with advanced disease. Chemotherapeutic agents are now being used in conjunction with surgery to reduce the risk of tumour spread. Furthermore, advances in surgical techniques have made resections possible in cases deemed inoperable in the past. In this review we present important advances in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer as reflected by recent literature that should be of interest to a wide variety of specialists.",Lung_Cancer

"We describe the strengths and challenges of the child healthcare system in Hungary. The number of children has been steadily decreasing since 1982. The number of live births per thousand population has decreased from 12.1 to 9.3 between 1990 and 2015. In 2015, the infant mortality rate was 4.2 deaths per 1000 live births, the lowest ever recorded in Hungary. In 2012, 96% of infants were ever breastfed, following the guidelines, and 65% were exclusively breastfed. Vaccine coverage is over 99%. Primary care paediatricians provide primary healthcare for children under the age of 18 years. There is a special pediatric and a special preterm new-born transport system. The network of Neonatal Intensive Care Units within Hungary was set up in 1975, with the participation of 10 Neonatal Intensive Care Units. In 2015, there were 206,507 inpatient hospital admissions for children aged 0-18 years to acute hospitals. Acute pediatrics is mainly provided in pediatric departments in general hospitals with inpatient and outpatient care. After finishing medical university, there is a 5-year period of postgraduate pediatric training in certified hospitals and university pediatric departments. Hungary's healthcare system is on the brink of disaster. Low salaries and poor working conditions force physicians to either go abroad or work at a private institutions. Hungary will face a major shortage of paediatricians within ten years. The average age of paediatricians in Hungary is 59, 46% of whom are age over 60 years.

"The status of adjuvant therapy for colon cancer recently was clarified through the use of an innovative statistical evaluation of the existing published data. Even without including the NSABP results, meta-analysis formalized the long-held subjective impression that adjuvant treatment does not worsen patient outcome but, rather, consistently tends to improve it. It is important to recall that even small advantages for therapy of a common disease will have a major public health impact. A review of the results of adjuvant therapy in colon cancer thus far leads to suggestions for future directions, several of which already have been put into practice. Clearly, large-scale cooperative trials are necessary, not only to detect the subtle survival benefits of existing adjuvant therapies, but also to allow for meaningful subgroup analysis. Additional techniques for identifying and quantifying prognostic variables will aid in this latter effort. For example, flow cytometric DNA content analysis is currently in progress on patient specimens from several of the recently completed adjuvant trials, including those conducted by ECOG and NSABP. Not only will such analysis clarify the prognostic relevance of tumor ploidy and proliferative activity but, more importantly, it may identify subsets of patients who derive particular benefit from adjuvant treatment. Lastly, the need for more effective therapies is obvious. The current adjuvant trials employ agents or combinations of agents that hold some promise based on their activity in preliminary trials. However, significant progress will have to await the introduction of new agents with greater activity against colon cancer, and improvement in our understanding and use of specific immunotherapy.",Colon_Cancer

"Telomerase activation, a cardinal requirement for immortalization, is a crucial step in the development of malignancy and requires the induction of the catalytic component, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), encoded by the hTERT gene. By reverse transcription-PCR, using primers within the reverse transcriptase domain of hTERT, we investigated telomerase messenger in 8 adenomatous and 9 dysplastic polyps, and in 32 paired cancer-normal mucosa specimens, one liver and one spleen metastasis from patients resected for sporadic colorectal cancer. Telomerase messenger was absent or very low in normal mucosa and in adenomatous polyps. Dysplastic polyps and adenocarcinoma samples showed hTERT mRNA, with higher levels in cancer tissues compared to dysplastic lesions. A high telomerase messenger level was shown to be associated with late-staged cancers and with metastasis; thus, detection of telomerase messenger may be useful in the early diagnosis of colon cancer, and telomerase may be a new target for therapeutic intervention.",Colon_Cancer
"Conventional approaches to developing biomaterials and implants require intuitive tailoring of manufacturing protocols and biocompatibility assessment. This leads to longer development cycles, and high costs. To meet existing and unmet clinical needs, it is critical to accelerate the production of implantable biomaterials, implants and biomedical devices. Building on the Materials Genome Initiative, we define the concept 'biomaterialomics' as the integration of multi-omics data and high-dimensional analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools throughout the entire pipeline of biomaterials development. The Data Science-driven approach is envisioned to bring together on a single platform, the computational tools, databases, experimental methods, machine learning, and advanced manufacturing (e.g., 3D printing) to develop the fourth-generation biomaterials and implants, whose clinical performance will be predicted using 'digital twins'. While analysing the key elements of the concept of 'biomaterialomics', significant emphasis has been put forward to effectively utilize high-throughput biocompatibility data together with multiscale physics-based models, E-platform/online databases of clinical studies, data science approaches, including metadata management, AI/ Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and uncertainty predictions. Such integrated formulation will allow one to adopt cross-disciplinary approaches to establish processing-structure-property (PSP) linkages. A few published studies from the lead author's research group serve as representative examples to illustrate the formulation and relevance of the 'Biomaterialomics' approaches for three emerging research themes, i.e. patient-specific implants, additive manufacturing, and bioelectronic medicine. The increased adaptability of AI/ML tools in biomaterials science along with the training of the next generation researchers in data science are strongly recommended. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This leading opinion review paper emphasizes the need to integrate the concepts and algorithms of the data science with biomaterials science. Also, this paper emphasizes the need to establish a mathematically rigorous cross-disciplinary framework that will allow a systematic quantitative exploration and curation of critical biomaterials knowledge needed to drive objectively the innovation efforts within a suitable uncertainty quantification framework, as embodied in 'biomaterialomics' concept, which integrates multi-omics data and high-dimensional analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like machine learning. The formulation of this approach has been demonstrated for patient-specific implants, additive manufacturing, and bioelectronic medicine.",Generic
"SHARP1 is a basic helix loop helix transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation and differentiation. The present study assessed the role of SHARP1 in the progression and invasion of thyroid cancer. PCR and western blot analysis demonstrated that in thyroid cancer tissues, SHARP1 was significantly downregulated at the mRNA and protein level compared with that in normal tissues. Furthermore, SHARP1 was downregulated in the TT and TPC 1 thyroid cancer cell lines compared with a normal thyroid cell line, while it was upregulated in other thyroid cancer cell lines. Overexpression of SHARP1 in TT and TPC 1 cells significantly inhibited the cell viability, migration and invasion in vitro. Furthermore, the protein and mRNA levels of HIF 1 were found to be decreased in TT and TPC 1 cells following forced overexpression of SHARP1. In addition, silencing of HIF 1 reduced the viability, migration and invasion of TT and TPC-1 cells. In conclusion, the present study indicated that SHARP1 acts as a tumor suppressor in thyroid cancer and that its downregulation may contribute to the proliferation, migration and invasion of thyroid cancer cells through mechanisms possibly involving HIF 1 , suggesting that SHARP1 may be an important therapeutic target for the treatment of thyroid cancer.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Lung cancer incidence is now decreasing in US men. Although rates continue to increase in women, the rate of increase is declining. Most lung cancer in men and women is attributable to cigarette smoking. Histologic patterns are consistent with smoking trends for gender, race, and age. Trends in adenocarcinoma may be related to an increase in exposure to tobacco-specific nitrosamines from low-tar cigarettes. Other risk factors, including exposure to residential radon, occupational exposures, diet, and family history, have been shown to increase risk of lung cancer independent of cigarette smoking. Recent research in molecular epidemiology has greatly increased our understanding of the mechanism of lung carcinogenesis and the interactions between exposure to lung carcinogens (smoking, occupational exposures, radon), diet, and heritable variations in susceptibility.",Lung_Cancer
"Differentiated thyroid cancer is a cancer with a good prognosis but the presence of lymph node metastases is associated with increased rates of loco-regional recurrence and in some reports decreased survival. This has led to an increased interest in the lymph node status with guidelines calling for routine central node dissection and increased interest in lateral compartment node sampling and sentinel node biopsy. We know from studies in regions where routine central and ipsilateral node dissection is the preferred surgical management of differentiated thyroid cancer that lymph node metastases are present in the majority of cases and that many of these are micrometastatic deposits. However, where routine node dissection is not performed recurrence rates are relatively low suggesting that not all micrometastatic disease progresses to a loco-regional recurrence or that the majority of disease is mopped up by adjuvant radioactive iodine. This review examines the available evidence for the significance of micrometastatic disease in differentiated thyroid cancer and suggests that it is probably of little clinical significance and does not warrant further aggressive surgical intervention. We would expect a conservative surgical approach combined with adjuvant radioactive iodine to lead to durable disease control.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces lung cancer deaths by early detection. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends lung cancer screening with LDCT in adults of age 50 years to 80 years who have at least a 20 pack-year smoking history and are currently smoking or have quit within the past 15 years. The implementation of a lung-cancer-screening program is complex. High-quality screening requires the involvement of a multidisciplinary team. The aim of a screening program is to find balance between mortality reduction and avoiding potential harms related to false-positive findings, overdiagnosis, invasive procedures, and radiation exposure.

"Cutaneous metastases from the lung are rare but must be ruled out in patients with suspicious skin lesions and history of smoking or lung cancer. All histological types of lung cancer may metastasize to the skin and clinical lesions are variable. The percentage of patients with lung cancer that develop cutaneous metastases ranges from 1 to 12 percent. In 20-60 percent of cases the skin lesions present before or synchronously with the diagnosis of the primary tumor. Skin lesions are often described as nodular, mobile or fixed, hard or flexible, single or multiple, and painless. Histologically, cutaneous metastases from the lung are frequently moderately or poorly differentiated. IHC markers that may be useful in these cases are anti-thyroid transcription factor (TTF) and CK7/20. Treatment of solitary cutaneous metastases usually includes surgery alone or combined with chemotherapy, and/or radiation. If multiple cutaneous lesions or internal metastases exist, chemotherapy is the primary option. Cutaneous metastases and their primaries in the lung are usually incurable and suggest an unfortunate prognosis. Poor prognostic indicators include non-resectable or small-cell primary tumors, multiple cutaneous metastases, or other distant metastases. Mean survival is usually about 5-6 months.",Lung_Cancer

Regimens that employ cross-sectional imaging and carcinoembryonic antigen determination appear to have the greatest benefit. A risk-adapted approach to follow-up, intensively following patients at highest risk of recurrence, increases efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Ongoing improvements in risk stratification, disease detection, and treatment will increase the benefits of postoperative surveillance.

"Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and its global incidence rates are rapidly increasing. Although the mortality of thyroid cancer is relatively low, its rate of recurrence or persistence is relatively high, contributing to incurability and morbidity of the disease. Thyroid cancer is mainly treated by surgery and radioiodine remnant ablation, which is effective only for non-metastasized primary tumors. Therefore, better understanding of the molecular targets available in this tumor is necessary. Similarly to many other tumor types, oncogenic molecular alterations in thyroid epithelium include aberrant signal transduction of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT (also known as protein kinase B), NF- B, and WNT/ -catenin pathways. However, the role of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) pathway, a well-known mediator of tumorigenesis in different tumor types, is relatively less understood in thyroid cancer. Intriguingly, recent studies have demonstrated that, in thyroid cancer, the JAK/STAT3 pathway may function in the context of tumor suppression rather than promoting tumorigenesis. In this review, we provide an update of STAT3 function in thyroid cancer and discuss some of the evidences that support this hypothesis.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women in the United States. It is also the leading cause of cancer death among men and the second leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Lung cancer rates and trends vary substantially by sex, age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography because of differences in historical smoking patterns. Lung cancer mortality rates in the United States are highest among males, blacks, people of lower socioeconomic status, and in the mid-South (e.g., Kentucky, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee). Globally, rates are highest in countries where smoking uptake began earliest, such as those in North America and Europe. Although rates are now decreasing in most of these countries (e.g., United States, United Kingdom, Australia), especially in men, they are increasing in countries where smoking uptake occurred later.

The respective biosynthetic routes and modifications are discussed, and also the regulation of riboflavin synthesis. As the terminal biosynthesis of riboflavin starts from the two precursors, ribulose 5-phosphate and guanosine triphosphate (GTP), both strains have been optimized for an improved flux through the pentose phosphate pathway as well as the purine biosynthetic pathway. Specific targets for improvement of A. gossypii were the increase of the glycine pool and the increase of carbon flow through the glyoxylic shunt. In B. subtilis, research interest, amongst others, has focused on gluconeogenesis and overexpression of the rib operon. In addition, insight into large-scale production of vitamin B2 is given, as well as future prospects and possible developments.",Generic
"Colorectal cancer is one of the major causes of death in the western world. Despite increasing knowledge of the molecular signaling pathways implicated in colon cancer, therapeutic outcomes are still only moderately successful. Sphingolipids, a family of N-acyl linked lipids, have not only structural functions but are also implicated in important biological functions. Ceramide, sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate are the most important bioactive lipids, and they regulate several key cellular functions. Accumulating evidence suggests that many cancers present alterations in sphingolipids and their metabolizing enzymes. The aim of this review is to discuss the emerging roles of sphingolipids, both endogenous and dietary, in colon cancer and the interaction of sphingolipids with WNT/ -catenin pathway, one of the most important signaling cascades that regulate development and homeostasis in intestine.

"Colorectal cancer is one of the so-called westernized diseases and the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. On the basis of global epidemiological and scientific studies, evidence suggests that the risk of colorectal cancer is increased by processed and unprocessed meat consumption but suppressed by fibre, and that food composition affects colonic health and cancer risk via its effects on colonic microbial metabolism. The gut microbiota can ferment complex dietary residues that are resistant to digestion by enteric enzymes. This process provides energy for the microbiota but culminates in the release of short-chain fatty acids including butyrate, which are utilized for the metabolic needs of the colon and the body. Butyrate has a remarkable array of colonic health-promoting and antineoplastic properties: it is the preferred energy source for colonocytes, it maintains mucosal integrity and it suppresses inflammation and carcinogenesis through effects on immunity, gene expression and epigenetic modulation. Protein residues and fat-stimulated bile acids are also metabolized by the microbiota to inflammatory and/or carcinogenic metabolites, which increase the risk of neoplastic progression. This Review will discuss the mechanisms behind these microbial metabolite effects, which could be modified by diet to achieve the objective of preventing colorectal cancer in Western societies.",Colon_Cancer

"Immunotherapy has emerged in recent years as a promising therapeutic approach in lung cancer. Two approaches are of particular interest: immune checkpoint inhibition, which aims to counteract the physiologic mechanisms of immune tolerance co-opted by some tumors, and vaccine therapy, which enables enhanced exposure to tumor antigen. Immune checkpoint therapies include the monoclonal antibody blockade of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) with ipilimumab, as well as antibody blockade of the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor and the PD-1 ligand. These immune checkpoint therapies have been evaluated in both non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with early evidence of activity. Vaccines include antigen specific therapies which induce specific antitumor immunity against relevant tumor-associated antigens. In lung cancer, these include the melanoma-associated antigen-A3 (MAGE-A3), membrane-associated glycoprotein (MUC-1), and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Whole tumor vaccines have also been evaluated in lung cancer and influence the patient's immune system to allow recognition of the tumor as foreign creating de novo immunity.

"Genetic alteration is the driving force for thyroid tumorigenesis and progression, based upon which novel approaches to the management of thyroid cancer can be developed. A recent important genetic finding in thyroid cancer is the oncogenic T1799A transversion mutation of BRAF (the gene for the B-type Raf kinase, BRAF). Since the initial report of this mutation in thyroid cancer 2 years ago, rapid advancements have been made. BRAF mutation is the most common genetic alteration in thyroid cancer, occurring in about 45% of sporadic papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs), particularly in the relatively aggressive subtypes, such as the tall-cell PTC. This mutation is mutually exclusive with other common genetic alterations, supporting its independent oncogenic role, as demonstrated by transgenic mouse studies that showed BRAF mutation-initiated development of PTC and its transition to anaplastic thyroid cancer. BRAF mutation is mutually exclusive with RET/PTC rearrangement, and also displays a reciprocal age association with this common genetic alteration in thyroid cancer. The T1799A BRAF mutation occurs exclusively in PTC and PTC-derived anaplastic thyroid cancer and is a specific diagnostic marker for this cancer when identified in cytological and histological specimens. This mutation is associated with a poorer clinicopathological outcome and is a novel independent molecular prognostic marker in the risk evaluation of thyroid cancer. Moreover, preclinical and clinical evaluations of the therapeutic value of novel specific mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibitors in thyroid cancer are anticipated. This newly discovered BRAF mutation may prove to have an important impact on thyroid cancer in the clinic.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Multikinase inhibitors are effective treatments for thyroid cancers, acting primarily as antiangiogenic agents. This year, advances have been made in selective targeting of RET and BRAF in patients with medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancers, respectively. However, H rthle cell carcinomas have a unique genomic landscape with no dominant truncal drivers, precluding simplistic approaches to therapeutic targeting.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Low-dose CT screening for lung cancer is a complex and controversial topic. This article reviews the history of lung cancer screening trials and addresses the principles and confounding biases associated with screening. Chest radiography was initially used for lung cancer screening in the 1970s. In the mid-1990s helical single-detector CT came into use, followed by helical multidetector CT, the current method of screening. Results from prevalence studies and a few single-arm incidence studies have raised concerns about overdiagnosis and the high rate of nodule detection. Follow-up studies and further investigation are needed. To this end, a randomized, controlled trial sponsored by the National Cancer Institute is underway to evaluate disease-specific mortality.",Lung_Cancer

"Metastatic tumors of the spleen are rare and usually occur in the presence of disseminated visceral metastases. The liver is the most common site of metastatic spread from colon cancer. We report a case of isolated intrasplenic metastasis from sigmoid colon cancer and review the possible reasons for the rarity of splenic metastasis. This represents the fifth reported case of isolated splenic metastasis from colon cancer. Splenectomy may be justified in presence of isolated metastatic disease, since it is an operation with a low complication rate and may provide potential long-term survival in colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"The lethality of lung cancer is related to the advanced stage at diagnosis. Initial studies have demonstrated that screening computed tomography (CT) is effective in diagnosing lung cancer at an earlier stage when compared with current clinical practice, however the best clinical approach for screening detected nodules has to be defined. The population to be identified as high risk should be over 50 years of age and should have smoked at least one pack/day for 20 years. CT protocols should use multidetector CT, low dose and a 2.5 reconstruction interval. Diagnostic workup on detected nodules should be designed according to size and consider CT at 3 or 12 months to evaluate doubling time, CT enhancement, PET/CT and/or FNAB or VATS. The prevalence of lung cancer in the screened population is 1.1%-2.7%, and the incidence is 0.2%-1.1%. Eighty-one percent of cancers are diagnosed in stage I. The percentage of surgery performed for benign lesions ranges from 21% to 55%. In our series, the overall mortality rate was 3.2% in 5 years. The results of randomized clinical studies, when available, will assess the real efficacy of CT in reducing lung cancer related mortality.",Lung_Cancer
"Acromegaloidism is a condition characterized by features of acromegaly without biochemical evidence of excessive growth hormone (GH) production. Insulin resistance is one of the possible etiologies. We report the case of a patient with acromegalic features, a left lung neoplastic process, generalized acanthosis nigricans and severe insulin resistance. Normal IGF 1 and GH inhibition below 1 ng/ml by the oral glucose tolerance test ruled out the diagnosis of acromegaly. Acanthosis nigricans (AN) may be present as a paraneoplastic syndrome or may be associated to benign pathology in which insulin resistance is involved. Acromegaloidism has been reported in patients with severe insulin resistance as we are describing here. It is possible that very high insulin levels can stimulate excessive acral growth acting through insulin receptors that retain the ability to mediate anabolic effects, or alternatively through the IGF1 receptor. We found no data of acromegaloidism as a paraneoplastic syndrome. To summarize, we report a case of severe insulin resistance, pseudoacromegaly and AN, coexisting with a lung carcinoma. Acromegaloidism and AN appear to be due to insulin resistance, even though in this patient we cannot exclude that AN could be a paraneoplastic syndrome.",Lung_Cancer

It has been shown, presence in relatives thyroid cancer and malignant new growths is thyroid cancer risk factor.

"The relationship between dietary factors and mortality from colon cancer was explored by an analysis of the correlation between age-adjusted colon cancer death rates for men in 38 countries and estimates of the availability of a number of dietary components. Cereals were the only source of fiber found to be negatively associated with colon cancer mortality after adjustment for the availability of total or animal fats, or total or red meats, foods that were themselves positively associated with mortality. The estimate of dietary fiber from cereals was more closely associated with mortality than that of crude fiber. The previously postulated protective effects of vitamins C and A and of cruciferous vegetables were not supported by the international data; we found no evidence of a negative association between colon cancer mortality and availability of these dietary factors. The positive association previously reported between colon cancer and beer consumption disappeared following adjustment for animal fat.",Colon_Cancer
"In small cell lung cancer, combination chemotherapy including platinum compounds (cisplatin and carboplatin) and the podophyllotoxins (teniposide and etoposide) continues to be the backbone of therapy. Complete plus partial responses to combination chemotherapy occur in 80-90% of all patients. Median survival is at present 11-17 months depending on the initial tumour stage. Overall 5-year survival is approximately 5%. The duration of treatment has been shortened to 5-6 months. The results of the use of hematopoietic growth factors have hitherto been disappointing with respect to survival, while a definite effect on the degree and number of infections has been documented, when aggressive chemotherapy is administered. For epidermoid-, adenoid- and large cell carcinoma, results are emerging indicating that preoperative and preirradiatory chemotherapy in stage IIIa non-small cell lung cancer might have a substantial role in the overall management based on results from phase III trials. The studies are, however, rather modest in number and longer follow-up is necessary before recommendations for general use can be made. For patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (stage IIIb and IV), meta-analyses have yielded a small survival benefit (6 weeks) in favour of patients receiving chemotherapy vs. best supportive care. The treatment of this type of NSCLC should, however, still be considered to be experimental in order to define new innovative treatments. No improvement of the therapy of mesotheliomas has been reported.",Lung_Cancer
"Distant metastases from thyroid cancer of follicular origin are uncommon. Treatment includes levothyroxine administration, focal treatment modalities with surgery, external radiation therapy and thermal ablation, and radioiodine in patients with uptake of 131I in their metastases.

"A case-control study involving interviews with 672 female lung cancer patients and 735 population-based controls was conducted to investigate the high rates of lung cancer, notably adenocarcinoma, among women in Shanghai. Cigarette smoking was a strong risk factor, but accounted for only about one-fourth of all newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer. Most patients, particularly with adenocarcinoma, were life-long non-smokers. The risks of lung cancer were higher among women reporting tuberculosis and other pre-existing lung diseases. Hormonal factors were suggested by an increased risk associated with late menopause and by a gradient in the risk of adenocarcinoma with decreasing menstrual cycle length, with a 3-fold excess among women who had shorter cycles. Perhaps most intriguing were associations found between lung cancer and measures of exposure to cooking oil vapors. Risks increased with the numbers of meals cooked by either stir frying, deep frying or boiling; with the frequency of smokiness during cooking; and with the frequency of eye irritation during cooking. Use of rapeseed oil, whose volatiles following high-temperature cooking may be mutagenic, was also reported more often by the cancer patients. The findings thus confirm that factors other than smoking are responsible for the high risk of lung cancer among Chinese women and provide clues for further research, including the assessment of cooking practices.",Lung_Cancer
"Selikoff was among the first to emphasize the etiologic role of cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure in lung cancer. Recent reports suggest that aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy combined with surgery have improved the prognosis in lung cancer. The outcome of 100 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) seen in 1979-1980 was compared with the outcome of 100 patients seen in 1989-1990. The two groups consisted of consecutive patients with proven NSCLC who were referred to a pulmonary consultant. In 28 of the earlier patients and 38 of the later group the cancers were completely resectable. Only 12 of the 1979-1980 group have been cured of their cancer, while 25 of the 1989-1990 are free of cancer during the less than 2-year follow-up period. It can be assumed that this number will diminish with time. Current treatment of NSCLC with surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy has done little to improve the prognosis of lung cancer in the past 10 years. As stressed by Selikoff, the best available current method for control of lung cancer is prevention.",Lung_Cancer
"The potential for substantial improvement in the outcome of patients with carcinoma of the lung seem most likely to develop in the field of chemotherapy. In the past decade, striking advances in the management of small cell carcinoma have yielded response rates and longer survival. While the greatest improvement can be predicted for patients whose disease is limited in extent, combination chemotherapy and combined modality therapy generally are effective in causing tumor regression for the majority of patients. About 20 percent of patients with disease limited to the thorax and lymph nodes will survive two years. In non-small cell tumors, response rates are improved with intensive drug combinations, although the majority of cases are unresponsive to present regimens. Careful staging and evaluation of patients indicates that patients with good performance status and limited extent of disease appear to obtain the most benefit from intensive treatment. The considerable morbidity of some treatments often influences the choice for or against chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell carcinomas. For the future, problems of particular interest will be in investigation of factors-biologic, pharmacokinetic, immunologic-that are related to the failure to cure small cell carcinoma, the most therapeutically responsive pulmonary tumor. Additionally, in the non-small cell tumors, more effective therapies as well as clarification of the basis for relative resistance to cytotoxic agents are areas for intensive investigation.",Lung_Cancer
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is common and is associated with a considerable mortality. Morbidity and thereby mortality can be reduced by using different prevention strategies such as lifestyle interventions and chemoprevention. Endoscopic surveillance of high-risk individuals and population-based endoscopic screening of average-risk individuals enables detection and removal of premalignant lesions (adenomas) as well as presymptomatic detection of cancer. Implementation of cancer detection tests such as fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs) is another strategy to reduce cancer mortality by early detection of CRC. Personalized management, based on estimates of the individual risk using information concerning environmental factors, lifestyle, family history, personality, social background and phenotype in combination with a variety of biomarkers such as genotype, will become more important as a strategy to optimize CRC prevention in the future.",Colon_Cancer
"Dyspnea is a subjective symptom defined as an experience of uncomfortable and difficult breathing which strongly affects the quality of life. It is the most common symptom in lung cancer but its physiopathology remains unclear. Dyspnea is due to cancer itself, specific therapies or comorbidities. To evaluate intensity of dyspnea, analogue visual and verbal rating scales need to be preferred. Diagnosis of underlying cause, based on rational and non invasive strategy is needed to perform effective treatment if possible. Despite its frequency, few therapies are really effective, except nonpharmacologic measures: only morphine can be actually recommend, especially with naive patients. In palliative cases, if dyspnea is uncontrolled, benzodiazepine can be used and may represent ethic approach.",Lung_Cancer
"The past 5-10 years have brought in a new era in the care of patients with thyroid cancer, with the introduction of transformative diagnostic and management options. Several international ultrasound-based thyroid nodule risk stratification systems have been developed with the goal of reducing unnecessary biopsies. Less invasive alternatives to surgery for low-risk thyroid cancer, such as active surveillance and minimally invasive interventions, are being explored. New systemic therapies are now available for patients with advanced thyroid cancer. However, in the setting of these advances, disparities exist in the diagnosis and management of thyroid cancer. As new management options are becoming available for thyroid cancer, it is essential to support population-based studies and randomised clinical trials that will inform evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of thyroid cancer, and to include diverse patient populations in research to better understand and subsequently address existing barriers to equitable thyroid cancer care.",Thyroid_Cancer

A review of 119 patients (88 males and 31 females) with carcinoma of the lung seen at the Hospital University Sains Malaysia (HUSM) from 1984 to 1989 was done. The mean age of the patients was 60.3 years with a high proportion (76.6%) of them were between 41 and 70 years. Seventy five percent of patients (84% of men and 26% of women) were smokers. The Chinese have a significantly higher preponderance to carcinoma of the lung. The commonest histological type found was squamous cell carcinoma in men and adenocarcinoma in women. Small cell carcinoma was uncommon. Squamous cell and large cell/undifferentiated type of carcinoma were significantly associated with smoking behaviour of the patients.,Lung_Cancer
"This study evaluates the potential ability of a specific panel of DNA mutations to identify right-sided colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) that would be missed by a flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) screening program. This panel could then be applied to stool DNA analysis for noninvasive proximal CRC detection. A series of resected right-sided CRCs from 101 patients who had no left-sided advanced colonic neoplasms distal to the splenic flexure were analyzed. Tumor DNA was isolated from microdissected tumor sections. Deletions in the BAT-26 locus, a marker of microsatellite instability, and mutations at 19 loci spread among the p53, K-ras, and Apc genes were detected following PCR amplification. Mutations were identified in 83% of successfully amplified samples and were variably present in each of the target sites: p53 (42%), Apc (37%), K-ras (28%), and BAT-26 (24%). Mutations were identified across all Dukes stages (CIS/A 6/8 [75%], B 41/51[80%], C 30/32 (94%), and D 6/9 [67%]). Our data suggest that this 20-marker mutation panel may be associated with more than 80% of cancers undetectable by FS. The adjunctive use of stool DNA mutation analysis using this marker panel in FS CRC screening programs may significantly increase the detection of proximal CRC.",Colon_Cancer
"Changes in the structure and number of cell junctions have been related to the infiltrative and metastatic potential of tumor cells. Apparently, the loss of cell adhesion should be coordinated with significant changes in the apical and basal cell domains. The authors have performed a sequential ultrastructural study of cells in the superficial, middle, and deep regions of well- and moderately differentiated colon adenocarcinomas. This was to investigate the differences in the organization of different membrane domains among tumor cells in the in situ areas, the advancing, infiltrative edge of the tumors, and the infiltrating zones between these two extreme zones. The results of the study suggest that the organization of these domains is not strictly coordinated, and that, for each infiltration level, both a settling and an infiltrating cell population can be found. These findings could explain the fact that apparently well-differentiated tumors are able to seed distant tissues with individual cells, rather than with well-differentiated glandular aggregates that would hardly be able to reach the vessel lumina without significantly modifying their organization.",Colon_Cancer
"As we expand our knowledge of the initiators and promoters of lung cancer, early detection and intervention strategies show great potential in individuals at high risk, especially smokers and exsmokers. Documented mutations of dominant oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in human lung cancer cells may represent important steps in the pathogenesis of invasive cancer. The precise molecular events and their sequence that lead to tumor promotion in lung cancer, however, are less well understood. Chemointervention with agents like the retinoids may halt proliferation of cancer cells prior to the development of metastatic competence. Use of anti-growth-factor therapy and peptide hormone antagonists may also have a role in intervention approaches.

"Cervical lymph nodes (LNs) in the central (level VI) and lateral (levels II-V) compartments of the neck are the most common sites of locoregional metastases associated with thyroid cancer. Prophylactic nodal dissections are uncommon in modern thyroid surgery and are not routinely performed due to concern for increased morbidity and do not offer improved survival. Therefore, a selective approach for LN dissections is increasingly important. Preoperatively, this is most frequently assessed with cervical ultrasound (US). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck can also be used for preoperative assessment. Both US and CT imaging can be used to characterise LNs in levels II-VI and their risk of malignancy based on size, morphology, and growth. US-guided fine-needle aspiration of equivocal LN with thyroglobulin (Tg) washout can also determine if a LN harbours malignancy. For postoperative surveillance after total thyroidectomy, both US and CT continue to play an important role at 6-12 months intervals. These patients may also benefit from additional biochemical data such as Tg levels in addition to LN and thyroid bed imaging. Thyroid uptake scans may also play a role in LN surveillance postoperatively for well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma in certain clinical contexts. Less commonly, positron emitted tomography may play a role, but is typically reserved for patients with aggressive or radioactive iodine refractory disease.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is rare but aggressive. It can be cured only if intrathyroid at diagnosis. MTC can be sporadic (75%) or familial (25%) and the 2 forms are distinguished by RET mutations analysis.

"The 2013 discovery of Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations chr5, 1,295,228 C>T (C228T) and 1,295,250 C>T (C250T) in thyroid cancer represents an important event in the thyroid cancer field and much progress has occurred since then. This article provides a comprehensive review of this exciting new thyroid cancer field. The oncogenic role of TERT promoter mutations involves their creation of consensus binding sites for E-twenty-six transcriptional factors. TERT C228T is far more common than TERT C250T and their collective prevalence is, on average, 0, 11.3, 17.1, 43.2 and 40.1% in benign thyroid tumors, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), follicular thyroid cancer, poorly differentiated thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer, respectively, displaying an association with aggressive types of thyroid cancer. TERT promoter mutations are associated with aggressive thyroid tumor characteristics, tumor recurrence and patient mortality as well as BRAF V600E mutation. Coexisting BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations have a robust synergistic impact on the aggressiveness of PTC, including a sharply increased tumor recurrence and patient mortality, while either mutation alone has a modest impact. Thus, TERT with promoter mutations represents a prominent new oncogene in thyroid cancer and the mutations are promising new diagnostic and prognostic genetic markers for thyroid cancer, which, in combination with BRAF V600E mutation or other genetic markers (e.g. RAS mutations), are proving to be clinically useful for the management of thyroid cancer. Future studies will specifically define such clinical utilities, elucidate the biological mechanisms and explore the potential as therapeutic targets of TERT promoter mutations in thyroid cancer.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare type of thyroid cancer, demonstrating variable behavior from indolent disease to highly aggressive, progressive disease. There are distinguishing phenotypic features of sporadic and hereditary MTC. Activation or overexpression of cell surface receptors and up-regulation of intracellular signaling pathways in hereditary and sporadic MTC are involved in the disease pathogenesis. There has been an exponential rise in clinical trials with investigational agents, leading to approval of 2 medications for progressive, advanced MTC. Developments in understanding the pathogenesis of MTC will hopefully lead to more effective and less toxic treatments of this rare but difficult to treat cancer.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Although most thyroid cancers may be cured by surgery and 131I therapy, approximately 10-20% of patients die from advanced differentiated and anaplastic tumors that are unresponsive to conventional treatments. Thus, alternative approaches such as gene therapy are of interest, especially using targeted therapeutic gene delivery. Several strategies have been designed specifically for thyroid cancer and some have proven to be feasible in preclinical studies. In particular, it is suggested that combined gene therapy approaches, as well as multimodality therapeutic regimens, including gene therapy and conventional treatments, should be pursued to achieve clinically significant results. The recent discovery of new markers of thyroid cancer should improve the efficacy of gene therapy.",Thyroid_Cancer
"In small cell lung cancer, combination chemotherapy including agents such as etoposide, teniposide, cisplatin, doxorubicin, vincristine and cyclophosphamide continues to be the backbone of therapy. Epipodophyllotoxin derivatives, together with cisplatin, are used increasingly as part of the initial therapy. Complete plus partial responses to combination chemotherapy still occur in 80-90% of all patients with a median duration of 9-11 months. Median survival in these studies is at present 11-16 months depending on the initial tumour stage. Deaths from small cell lung cancer continue to occur until 7 years after diagnosis, but rarely thereafter. At this point, overall survival is around 5% and include a small fraction of patients (1%) initially presenting with extensive disease. The optimum duration of treatment is still uncertain. For patients with extensive disease, the use of alternating chemotherapy has been shown in a couple of randomized studies to yield the best results, as judged by long-term survival. The results of several phase II studies stress the importance of dose scheduling of etoposide in small cell lung cancer, with continuous treatment of 5 days' duration or more being superior. The therapeutic results for epidermoid, adenoid, large cell carcinoma and mesothelioma are essentially unchanged. The treatment of patients with these types of lung cancer should continue to be considered experimental, since no standard chemotherapy has as yet been developed, neither when given as single modality nor in combination with surgery or radiotherapy. One single study comparing induction chemotherapy before irradiation vs irradiation alone has resulted in an improvement of median survival of 4 months and doubled the number of long-term survivors. Since three-fourths of the patients with locoregional disease will die within 3 years, further improvements in both systemic and local treatment are needed.",Lung_Cancer
"Screening for lung cancer is not currently recommended, even in persons at high risk for this condition. Most patients with lung cancer present with symptomatic disease that is usually at an incurable, advanced stage. The recently reported NLST (National Lung Screening Trial) showed a 20% decrease in deaths from lung cancer in high-risk persons undergoing screening with low-dose computed tomography of the chest compared with chest radiography. The high-risk group included in the trial comprised asymptomatic persons aged 55 to 74 years, with smoking history of at least 30 pack-years. Screening with low-dose computed tomography detected more cases of early-stage lung cancer and fewer cases of advanced-stage cancer, confirming that screening has shifted the stage of cancer at diagnosis and provides more persons with the opportunity for curative treatment. Although computed tomography screening has risks and limitations, the 20% decrease in deaths is the single most dramatic decrease ever reported for deaths from lung cancer, with the possible exception of smoking cessation. Physicians should offer computed tomography screening for lung cancer to patients who fit the high-risk profile defined in the NLST.",Lung_Cancer
"Hereditary thyroid carcinomas are present in about 5% of differentiated (DTC) and 25% of medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC). They are part of a multiorgan tumour syndrome (e. g. FAP Gardner's syndrome with DTC and MEN 2 syndrome with MTC) or confined to the thyroid gland. Hereditary thyroid carcinomas typically show multifocal growth and occur in young patients. Due to germ cell mutations as the underlying cause of disease, partial thyroidectomies that may be justified in early sporadic carcinomas are not indicated in this type of tumours. In the case of hereditary DTC, the genetic basis of the disease has been demonstrated only in syndromatic tumour variants. In most nonsyndromatic cases, specific genetic alterations have not yet been identified. In both types of hereditary DTC, prophylactic thyroidectomy is not warranted due to the favourable prognosis of tumours that do not differ from sporadic ones. Point mutations of the RET proto-oncogene have been known for 15 years to be the genetic basis of hereditary MTC. Recently several new mutations were discovered; however, final conclusions regarding their clinical significance are not possible at present. Basically it has been shown that the clinical aggressivity of tumour development follows a genotype-phenotype correlation (risk groups 1-3). However, in mutations of all risk classes there exists a wide spectrum of different stages of hereditary C-cell disease in individual risk groups. Regarding time and extent of prophylactic thyroidectomy (without or with lymph node dissection) a combined molecular-biochemical concept including the use of pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin values is therefore recommended.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Spurred by advances in processing power, memory, storage, and an unprecedented wealth of data, computers are being asked to tackle increasingly complex learning tasks, often with astonishing success. Computers have now mastered a popular variant of poker, learned the laws of physics from experimental data, and become experts in video games - tasks that would have been deemed impossible not too long ago. In parallel, the number of companies centered on applying complex data analysis to varying industries has exploded, and it is thus unsurprising that some analytic companies are turning attention to problems in health care. The purpose of this review is to explore what problems in medicine might benefit from such learning approaches and use examples from the literature to introduce basic concepts in machine learning. It is important to note that seemingly large enough medical data sets and adequate learning algorithms have been available for many decades, and yet, although there are thousands of papers applying machine learning algorithms to medical data, very few have contributed meaningfully to clinical care. This lack of impact stands in stark contrast to the enormous relevance of machine learning to many other industries. Thus, part of my effort will be to identify what obstacles there may be to changing the practice of medicine through statistical learning approaches, and discuss how these might be overcome.",Generic
"Nowadays, patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer harbouring a driver mutation undergo targeted treatment. This results in profound tumour responses but inevitably induces resistance after approximately 9 to 12 months. In this article we consider the importance and clinical implications of taking new biopsies to retrieve information regarding resistance mechanisms. There is a shift in the use of other modalities such as radiotherapy and surgery in patients with oligometastatic disease, producing long-lasting responses. This is illustrated by three different patient cases: one with an EGFR exon 21 mutation, obtaining a T790M mutation upon treatment; another with a BRAF V600 mutation initially treated with chemotherapy and later with targeted therapy; and, finally, a patient with an ALK translocation with progression on crizotinib treatment, responding to subsequent alectinib therapy. The latter developed oligometastatic disease that was treated with radiotherapy, resulting in a complete response for at least 2 years.",Lung_Cancer
"The incidence of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer has increased over the last several decades. This change is influenced by several factors, to include the status of iodine sufficiency, access to the health care system and, perhaps most significantly, the increased use of radiological imaging. Thorough evaluation of a thyroid nodule includes review of the patient's medical and family history, followed by thyroid ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Similar to adults, the majority of nodules in children are benign; however, there is a 3- to 5-fold higher risk that a nodule found in a pediatric patient ( 18 years) will be malignant when compared to an adult. Differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) is the most common malignancy with approximately 90-95% being papillary thyroid carcinoma and the remainder follicular thyroid carcinoma. With proper evaluation and management, the prognosis for pediatric patients with DTC is excellent; however, the risk of treatment complications and recurrence is relatively high. The development of pediatric specific guidelines for the evaluation and management of thyroid nodules and DTC as well as the creation of centers with surgical and medical expertise is crucial in order to optimize care and gain a better understanding of factors that impact disease-specific morbidity.",Thyroid_Cancer
"In 1968, the first of three screening projects employing chest x-ray and sputum cytology was begun at Johns Hopkins. Subsequently, Mayo Clinic and Preventive Medicine Institute were added to form the Early Lung Cancer Detection Group. The Johns Hopkins and Mayo Clinic projects employ a chest x-ray annually for all participants and a quarterly sputum cytology for the study group. The Mayo Clinic utilizes a chest x-ray and sputum cytology quarterly for the study group and follow-up only for the comparison group. Entry in the study requires a screening examination for all participants, and those who have lung cancer at the initial examination constitute a ""prevalence"" group. Those who do not have a lung cancer at the initial examination are randomized into study and comparison groups. The goal was to determine if mortality from lung cancer could be reduced and if so, how much? That evaluation is not yet available. Prevalence data and incidence rate, stage at diagnosis, and survival by stage are now available. The diagnostic value of each modality, chest x-ray, and sputum cytology has been determined and varies by tumor cell type and location.",Lung_Cancer

"From thyroid nodules to thyroid cancer Abstract. The prevalence of thyroid nodules is around 1 % per life year, whereas 5 % of the nodules are malignant. Primary diagnostics consist of examination of TSH and cervical ultrasound. Depending on the findings, additional laboratory investigations, a scintigraphy or a biopsy are indicated. In case of thyroid cancer, the primary treatment is usually surgery. There are at least nine different clinical guidelines worldwide to provide a standardized perioperative management, whereas the guidelines of the German Association of Endocrine Surgeons (CAEK) and the American Thyroid Association (ATA) are most frequently used in the German speaking part of Europe. Individual therapy concepts are determined at the interdisciplinary endocrinological tumour boards. The indication for postoperative radioiodine treatment or thyroid hormone supplementation in TSH suppression dose in case of differentiated (papillary or follicular) thyroid cancer is evaluated according to the American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk stratification.",Thyroid_Cancer

"This review is focused on ""new drugs"" that might be developed for thyroid cancer treatment. Thyroid cancer is frequently associated to the activation of specific protein (RET, BRAF) and lipid [PI(3)K] kinases. There is good evidence that these genetic lesions are causative events in thyroid cancer initiation or progression. Therefore, novel compounds able to target these kinases might be useful for thyroid cancer treatment. The power of this approach is witnessed by the examples of BCR-ABL, c-KIT and EGFR inhibitors in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), gastro-intestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).",Thyroid_Cancer
"Background: Familial non-medullary thyroid cancer (NMTC) accounts for a relatively small proportion of thyroid cancer cases, but it displays strong genetic predisposition. So far, only a few NMTC susceptible genes and low-penetrance variants contributing to NMTC have been described. This study aimed to identify rare germline variants that may predispose individuals to NMTC by sequencing a cohort of 17 NMTC families. Methods: Whole-genome sequencing and genome-wide linkage analysis were performed in 17 NMTC families. MendelScan and BasePlayer were applied to screen germline variants followed by customized filtering. The remaining candidate variants were subsequently validated by Sanger sequencing. A panel of 277 known cancer predisposition genes was also screened in these families. Results: A total of 41 rare coding candidate variants in 40 genes identified by whole-genome sequencing are reported, including 24 missense, five frameshift, five splice change, and seven nonsense variants. Sanger sequencing confirmed all 41 rare variants and proved their co-segregation with NMTC in the extended pedigrees. In silico functional analysis of the candidate genes using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed that cancer was the top category of ""Diseases and Disorders."" Additionally, a targeted search displayed six variants in known cancer predisposition genes, including one frameshift variant and five missense variants. Conclusions: The data identify rare germline variants that may play important roles in NMTC predisposition. It is proposed that in future research including functional characterization, these variants and genes be considered primary candidates for thyroid cancer predisposition.",Thyroid_Cancer
"In the early 1900s, lung cancer was a rare malignancy in women, but starting from the 1960s it has progressively reached epidemic proportions, surpassing breast cancer in 1987 and becoming the leading cause of cancer deaths in many countries. Retrospective data show that the 5-year survival rate for women who have lung cancer is 15.6%, compared with 12.5% for men, and this improved survival could have important implications in the design and interpretation of lung cancer trials. Women have major responses to therapy regardless of stage, therapeutic modalities or histology. The increase of lung cancer incidence among women is reflected in their clinical trial participation, causing a survival improvement and suggesting the need of stratification by sex in future studies. No specific drugs for women with lung cancer are currently available, but researchers are devoting energies in this area in order to better understand the implication of gender differences in epidemiology, pathogenesis, prognosis and tumor response.",Lung_Cancer
"Since 1962, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has used an individually optimized dosimetry method for patients with thyroid carcinoma undergoing radioiodine therapy. This traditional dosimetry method involves a determination of the maximum tolerated activity or the activity that will deliver 2 Gy to the blood (A(max)), and the corresponding ablative lesion dose (D(lesion)). However, the traditional calculations of A(max) and D(lesion) were based on empirical assumptions. The objective of this work was to develop a dosimetry method that eliminates these assumptions by incorporating patient kinetics and that is not restricted to 131I as a tracer and therapeutic agent.",Thyroid_Cancer

In non-treated patients the brain was involved about twice as frequently, as in patients who received a pathogenetically-substantiated treatment. In both groups the brain involvement was observed mainly in patients suffering from adenocarcinoma and non-differentiated cancer. Early surgical removal of the brain metastases performed may prolong the patient's life by one to two years. A similar effect is produced by radiation therapy of focal affection of the brain in cases of oat-cell cancer.",Lung_Cancer
"Venous thromboembolism (TE) is a frequent occurrence in lung cancer patients and can be precipitated by venous stasis, the activation of clotting cascades by pro-coagulant tumour factors and by vascular injury due to chemotherapy and central venous catheters. Subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has replaced intravenous unfractionated heparin in the treatment of acute TE. The use of long-term LMWH is recommended to prevent the recurrence of TE. Prophylactic treatment is indicated in patients undergoing surgery or hospitalised.

"The expression of cancer-testis (CT) genes varies with tumor type. There are tumors with high, low, and intermediate gene expressions. Tumor cells of different origin are characterized by ST gene co-expression. The expression of ST genes increases in later stages of tumor development in the presence of metastases. In colon cancer, the tumor samples showed most frequently MAGE-A and SSX mRNA. The peripheral blood samples displayed most commonly XAGE, MAGE-C, and SSX mRNA. In patients with colon cancer, the expression of TSP50, MAGE-A(1-6), and SSX1,2,4 genes was associated with a poor prognosis, that of MAGE-C1 and XAGE1 was related to a favorable prognosis.",Colon_Cancer
"Colorectal cancer arises in individuals with acquired or inherited genetic predisposition who are exposed to a range of risk factors. Many of these risk factors are associated with affluent Western societies. More than 95% of colorectal cancers are sporadic, arising in individuals without a significant hereditary risk. Geographic variation in the incidence of colorectal cancer is considerable with a higher incidence observed in the West. Environmental factors contribute substantially to this variation. A number of these risk factors are associated with a Western lifestyle and could be considered a product of 'civilization'. Recently, smoking has been recognized as a risk factor. Energy consumption also influences colorectal cancer risk, with obesity increasing risk and exercise reducing risk. However, the strongest contribution to environmental risk for colorectal cancer is dietary. Consumption of fat, alcohol and red meat is associated with an increased risk. Fresh fruit and vegetables and dietary fibre may be protective. Much has been learnt recently about the molecular pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer always arises in the context of genomic instability. There is inactivation of the tumour suppressor genes adenomatous polyposis coli, p53, transforming growth factor- , activation of oncogene pathways including K-ras, and activation of the cyclooxygenase-2, epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor pathways. The mechanisms by which some environmental factors modify the mutation risk in these pathways have been described.",Colon_Cancer
"Colorectal cancer affected approximately 135,000 people in the United States in 2001, resulting in 57,000 deaths. At the cellular level, colorectal cancer results from the progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations that lead to the transformation of normal colonic epithelial cells to colon adenocarcinoma cells. The loss of genomic stability appears to be a key molecular and pathogenetic step that occurs early in the tumorigenesis process and serves to create a permissive environment for the occurrence of alterations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. At least three forms of genomic instability have been identified in colon cancer: (1) microsatellite instability (MSI), (2) chromosome instability (i.e. aneusomy, gains and losses of chromosomal regions) (CIN), and (3) chromosomal translocations. Microsatellite instability occurs in approximately 15% of colon cancers and results from inactivation of the mutation mismatch repair (MMR) system by either MMR gene mutations or hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter. MSI promotes tumorigenesis through generating mutations in target genes that possess coding microsatellite repeats, such as TGFBR2 and BAX. CIN is found in the majority of colon cancers and leads to a different pattern of gene alterations that contribute to tumor formation. CIN appears to result primarily from deregulation of the DNA replication checkpoints and mitotic-spindle checkpoints. The mechanisms that induce and influence genomic instability in cancer in general and more specifically in colon cancer are only partly understood and are consequently under intense investigation. These studies have revealed mutation of the mitotic checkpoint regulators BUB1 and BUBR1 and amplification of STK15 in a subset of CIN colon cancers. The etiology of CIN in the other unexplained cases of colon cancer remains to be determined. Hopefully, discovery of the cause and specific role of genomic instability in colon cancer will yield more effective chemotherapy strategies that take advantage of this unique characteristic of cancer cells.",Colon_Cancer
"Our relationship with the colonic bacterial flora has long been viewed as benign, but recent studies suggest that this symbiosis has risks as well as benefits. This relationship requires that the host not only provide a supportive environment for the symbiotic bacteria, but also actively maintain intact mechanisms for properly managing the physiologic stresses that are closely associated with the symbiont's essential survival functions. Failure to do so breaches the host-symbiont contract, and can result in serious effects on the health of the host. Recent investigations that employ several knockout mouse models reveal the consequences of genetic deficiency in the host regarding these mechanisms, and the latent, pro-inflammatory, tumorigenic nature of normal bacterial flora. Further study of the interactions between normal bacterial flora and hosts could shed light on the etiologies and pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and related cancers, with implications for human health.",Colon_Cancer

"BCNU, CCNU, and methyl-CCNU have undergone extensive trial in multiple drug combinations for bronchogenic carcinoma. The addition of a nitrosourea appears to be an improvement over cyclophosphamide used alone in oat cell carcinoma and over the two drug combination of cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in both adenocarcinoma of the lung and oat cell disease. Encouraging response rates have been seen in squamous lung cancer with multiple-drug combinations of a nitrosourea, an alkylating agent, vincristine, and bleomycin with or without adriamycin. The nitrosoureas have been easily incorporated, at reduced doses, into multiple-drug regimens with cumulative myelosuppression seen only when the interval between nitrosourea doses is less than 6 weeks. Conclusions about the ultimate role of these compounds in lunb cancer treatment must await (a) comparative trials of combinations with and without a nitrosourea, and (b) further exploration of new approaches to increase their therapeutic index.",Lung_Cancer
"In the past few years there have been major changes in the treatment landscape in oncology; lung cancer is affected by those changes like almost no other solid tumor. The rise of further second- and third-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors offers sequential therapy for patients with mutated non-small-cell lung cancer. Immunotherapy has found its way into clinical routine and presents us with new challenges in managing side effects, evaluating treatment response and deciding on how long we treat our patients. The treatment algorithm of lung cancer has changed in the last month and further practice-changing trials are coming up, so treating lung cancer patients shows nowadays a more challenging perspective with the possibility of subsequently applied individual therapies.

"Lung cancer has now surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths in American women. In 1986, 49,000 women were diagnosed as having lung cancer; only 16 percent of them will survive 5 years or more. Cigarette smoking is unquestionably the leading contributing factor. Large numbers of women took up cigarette smoking during and after World War II. The grim aftermath has taken 20 years to surface--between 1950 and 1985, lung cancer deaths in women increased 500 percent. Even worse, statistics to the end of this century will show no improvement because of the large number of teenage girls and young women now smoking. Unfortunately, efforts at early diagnosis have usually been ineffective. By the time a chest X-ray reveals an abnormality, the patient is usually incurable. Surgery is currently the primary treatment, but is applicable only to those few women in whom the cancer has not spread and who are otherwise acceptable surgical candidates. Scientists are studying chemotherapy and immunotherapy for treatment, as well as exploring the possible preventive effects of various vitamins and minerals. The results of these latter studies will not be available for many years. It is estimated that people who stop smoking must allow 15 years for their risk to return to that of nonsmokers, but if every American woman gave up smoking today, by 2017 lung cancer in women might once again be a medical rarity.",Lung_Cancer

"Cancer of the thyroid is a rare malignant tumour in all parts of the world. The diagnosis is established by the clinical findings, thyroid scan, ultrasound, needle biopsy cytology. Solitary, solid tumours on ultrasound and scan have an increased risk of cancer, especially if these lesions show a further tendency to increase in size, despite sufficient suppressive treatment with thyroxine. In these cases the risk of cancer is more pronounced in nonendemic areas in men, in recurrent goitres, patients with a history of radiation of the neck during childhood, and with solitary lumps under 20 years and over 60 years of age. The surgical treatment includes lobectomy on the involved side and subtotal resection of the opposite lobe. Total thyroidectomy is generally used only for medullary carcinoma. In the future, a more selective surgical approach seems to be justified in thyroid cancer because of its varying malignancy. Close cooperation between the surgeon, the pathologist, the radiologist and the endocrinologist is essential in such circumstances. The prognosis of thyroid cancer is influenced by the histological type, the stage of the tumour, and the age of the patient. The prognosis is excellent in tumours limited to the thyroid gland and in those of papillary type or follicular type with little vascular invasion. Undifferentiated tumours always have a bad prognosis.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The incidence of lung cancer is increasing in Japan and it is important to know whether a patient has a history of primary smoking/second-hand smoking because smoking is the main cause of lung cancer. Lung cancer is often found on chest roentgenography.

Most lung cancers are detected in the advanced stage with metastasis. Performance status should be useful for the estimation of the prognosis of patients. In the symposium, we reported two of our clinical cases, in which urinary deoxypyridinoline, a bone absorption marker, facilitated the discovery of the bone metastasis of lung cancers with negative bone scans.

Several new target-oriented drugs are under evaluation and some of them (cetuximab and bevacizumab) have already exhibited a good activity/efficacy, mainly in combination with chemotherapy.

"The prognosis for patients with cancer of the colon is dubious. An intendedly curative colon resection is performed in two-thirds of these patients, but half of them will subsequently die from metastatic disease. Randomized trials of adjuvant therapy with fluorouracil in combination with levamisole or leucovorin have shown significant benefit in terms of increased disease-free survival and overall survival. In 1990 adjuvant treatment was recommended as routine therapy in high risk patients in USA. A number of European countries are routinely treating high risk patients with Dukes' C coloncarcinoma. The recommendations are based on results from several cooperative trials reviewed in this article. Treatment related toxicity accelerates with increasing age but was acceptable in the reviewed trials. Adjuvant therapy is widely accepted as an important supplement to surgery in high risk patients. A Conference on the results and experiences now available should take place in the near future in order to establish a national consensus on adjuvant chemotherapy in Denmark. Patients with resected Dukes' C coloncarcinoma should receive adjuvant chemotherapy including 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin.

"In contrast to other tumour types inhibitors of PD-1/-L1 or CTLA 4 have not yet shown relevant efficacy in unselected colorectal cancer. Based on the high mutational burden, deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) or microsatellite instable (MSI-H) tumours are yet the only subgroup, which is amenable to checkpoint inhibition. These tumours show relevant and durable responses in the refractory setting by PD-1/-L1 +/- CTLA 4 inhibition. Thus, ongoing phase 3 trials in this subgroup evaluate immunotherapy in the adjuvant setting as well as in the first line metastatic setting with or without chemotherapy. For the by far larger subgroup of non-dMMR/MSI-H patients (95% in the metastatic setting) combination regimen are urgently required, either with chemotherapy and/or molecular targeting drugs, local ablative treatments or other immunotherapeutic agents (e.g. CEA-TCB).",Colon_Cancer
"Epidemiologic studies of the relationship of diet to cancer etiology are hampered by methodologic difficulties which can be overcome by careful trial design. The use of appropriate dietary assessment instruments is necessary to minimize bias and improve accuracy of diet assessment. Population studies implicate dietary fat intake in the etiology of colorectal carcinogenesis, and the incidence of colorectal malignancies around the world is positively correlated with meat and fat consumption and total calorie intake. Retrospective studies of fat intake yield equivocal results, whereas prospective studies have failed to show a relationship between fat intake and colon cancer risk. An inverse relationship exists between fiber consumption and colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates. The positive observational studies are supported by laboratory studies of experimental carcinogenesis which show a greater number of tumors in animals fed high-fat or high-calorie diets. Increased fiber intake appears to offer some protection against colorectal cancer. Plausible mechanisms have been proposed in animals for the role of fat and fiber in colorectal carcinogenesis; the mechanisms in human populations await further description. The interrelationships between fat consumption and consumption of dietary fiber and micronutrients have made it difficult to assess the roles of these substances in the etiology of colorectal cancer. Calcium offers protection in animal systems, and the data in humans are suggestive but not yet conclusive. Data on the role of alcohol in colorectal carcinogenesis remain inconclusive.

"Two thousand and three was a particularly dense year for publications and communications on therapy for colon cancer summarizing the real advance performed in this field. The last ten years allowed a rapid evolution for colon chemotherapy with a switch from 5-FU modulated by leucovorin to poly-chemotherapy (fluoropyrimidines with oxaliplatin or irinotecan) integrated into therapeutic strategies, where surgery had a place more and more important in metastatic patients. In correlation with these advances, median survival of patient with metastatic colorectal cancer is between 17 and 22 months. Targeted therapeutics with monoclonal antibody such as EGF inhibitors (cetuximab) or VEGF inhibitors (bevacizumab) had for the first time demonstrated efficacy with encouraging results in randomised trials. In adjuvant situation, LV5FU2 is less toxic than monthly FUFOL and no statistically significant difference could be detected in disease-free or overall survival between the two schedules. Oxaliplatin combined with 5 fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFOX4) is the first combination to demonstrate significant superiority over 5 fluorouracil and leucovorin in adjuvant treatment of colorectal cancer. Fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy benefited to patients with stage II or III colon cancer with microsatellite-stable tumours or tumour exhibiting low-frequency microsatellite instability but may be not those with tumours exhibiting high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI). These data need to be confirmed by prospective studies before changing our therapeutic references. The number of lymph nodes analyzed for colon cancer staging is itself a prognostic variable on outcome. Laparoscopic surgery of colon cancer is demonstrated as a feasible and safe procedure. Shrinkage of tumours after administration of preoperative chemotherapy and availability of ablative techniques (radiofrequency and cryotherapy) now allow to treat with curative intent metastases initially considered as non-resectable.",Colon_Cancer
"Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been isolated from several tumors and are implicated to play critical roles to increase malignant cell growth, invasion and metastasis. Here, we show that the MSC-like cells were isolated from human colon cancer tissues. These isolated hCC-MSCs (human colon cancer-derived mesenchymal stem cells) shared similar characteristic features with bone marrow-derived MSCs, which include cell morphology, surface antigens and specific gene expression. Additionally, the hCC-MSCs could differentiate into osteocytes or adipocytes under appropriate culture conditions. The conditioned medium collected from the cultured hCC-MSCs was shown to enhance the migration and invasive activity of HCT-116 colon cancer cells in vitro. Besides, transplantation of HCT-116 cells along with hCC-MSCs in nude mice increased the tumor growth and metastasis. Further study revealed that IL-6 present in the hCC-MSC-conditioned medium sufficiently induced the levels of Notch-1 and CD44 in HCT-116 and HT-29 cells, which contribute to enhance tumorigenic activity of HCT-116 and HT-29 cells. By using immunohistochemical staining, the intense co-expression of IL-6, Notch-1 and CD44 was predominantly detected in human colon cancer tissues. Taken together, our findings suggest the importance of the IL-6/Notch-1/CD44 signaling axis in the interaction between hCC-MSCs and colon cancer cells.",Colon_Cancer

"Mutations in KRAS are among the most frequent aberrations in cancer, including colon cancer. KRAS direct targeting is daunting due to KRAS protein resistance to small molecule inhibition. Moreover, its elevated affinity to cellular guanosine triphosphate (GTP) has made the design of specific drugs challenging. Indeed, KRAS was considered 'undruggable'. KRASG12C is the most commonly mutated variant of KRAS in non-small cell lung cancer. Currently, the achievements obtained with covalent inhibitors of this variant have given the possibility to assess the best therapeutic approach to KRAS-driven tumors. Mutation-related biochemical assets and the tissue of origin are expected to influence responses to treatment. Further attempts to obtain mutant-specific KRAS (KRASG12C) switch-II covalent inhibitors are ongoing and the results are promising.

"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Since tobacco smoking is the cause in vast majority of cases, the incidence of lung cancer is expected to rise in those countries with high or rising incidence of tobacco smoking. Even though populations at risk of developing lung cancer are easily identified, mass screening for lung cancer is not supported by currently available evidence. In the case of non-small cell lung cancer, a cure may be possible with surgical resection followed by post-operative chemotherapy in those diagnosed at an early stage. A small minority of patients who present with locally advanced disease may also benefit from pre-operative chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy to down stage the tumor to render it potentially operable. In a vast majority of patients, however, lung cancer presents at an advanced stage and a cure is not possible with currently available therapeutic strategies. Similarly, small cell lung cancer confined to one hemi-thorax may be curable with a combination of chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation followed by prophylactic cranial irradiation, if complete remission is achieved at the primary site. Small cell lung cancer that is spread beyond the confines of one hemi-thorax is, however, considered incurable.

After review only 74 (2%) were classified as lifelong non-smokers. They differed significantly from the 2996 smokers with lung cancer in that far more were female (77% v 26%) and their mean age was higher (75.4 v 68.0 years). More were in the worst Karnofsky performance categories and fewer patients underwent surgery. The stages of disease were similarly distributed in the two groups and the five year survival was equally poor (5%). Histological cell type was determined in 59 of the 74 patients. All histological cell types were present. More non-smokers had adenocarcinoma than smokers (42% v 13%) and fewer had squamous cell carcinoma (32% v 49%) or small cell carcinoma (15% v 24%). Lung cancer in lifelong non-smokers is uncommon and the diagnosis should therefore always be questioned.",Lung_Cancer
"Increasingly, basic research is being translated into clinical benefits for patients. Recent studies have shed more light on the clinical use of targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase and angiogenesis inhibitors, and predictive factors for their clinical benefit and their role in different clinical settings are now being elucidated. New insights into the basic biology of lung cancer hold translational promise in risk assessment, early detection, molecular staging, treatment response prediction and novel therapies. New targeted agents directed at apoptotic and developmental pathways have the potential to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities in the basic machinery of cancer. In addition, exploration of the cancer stem cell phenomenon in lung cancer may generate new approaches to prevent recurrence in surgically respectable lung cancer, and for the long-term control of extensive disease. Molecular profiling may also allow for highly individualized prognostic, predictive and therapeutic treatment plans tailored for each patient based on the molecular diagnostic profile of their tumour. Advances in genetic susceptibility, early detection and individualized therapy based on each tumour's unique biological properties all hold promise for the future management of lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer

"Familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer is more aggressive than sporadic nonmedullary thyroid cancer. It tends to affect younger patients, and the tumors are often multi-focal and bilateral. Histologically, 90% of these tumors are papillary cancers and the remaining are H rthle cell cancers. We recommend total thyroidectomy to remove all the thyroid tissue, which harbors the genetic defect responsible for the disease (even in low-risk patients) due to the predisposition to develop thyroid cancer and the more aggressive nature of the disease. Careful exploration of the ipsilateral lymph nodes with ipsilateral central neck dissection is encouraged to decrease a high recurrence rate (44%). A complete modified radical neck dissection should be limited to a therapeutic role because there is no clear evidence that this procedure carries any survival benefit. We also recommend that patients receive radioactive iodine ablation post-operatively, including a prophylactic dose (30 mCi) for patients with no evidence of residual uptake on the postoperative iodine 131 whole body scan and in low-risk patients using any of the prognostic scoring systems. Patients should be placed on enough thyroid hormone to suppress thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to approximately 0.1 mL/mL in low-risk patients and to less than 0.1 mL/mL in high-risk patients. Focal metastatic disease in patients with familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer is best dealt with by surgical excision followed by radioactive iodine ablation when appropriate. Redifferentiation therapy has a promising role in patients who have radioactive iodine-resistant tumors. The value of prevention, early detection, and targeted gene therapy once the gene or genes responsible for familial non-medullary thyroid cancer have been identified cannot be overemphasized.",Thyroid_Cancer
"In the era of big data, transformation of biomedical big data into valuable knowledge has been one of the most important challenges in bioinformatics. Deep learning has advanced rapidly since the early 2000s and now demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in various fields. Accordingly, application of deep learning in bioinformatics to gain insight from data has been emphasized in both academia and industry. Here, we review deep learning in bioinformatics, presenting examples of current research. To provide a useful and comprehensive perspective, we categorize research both by the bioinformatics domain (i.e. omics, biomedical imaging, biomedical signal processing) and deep learning architecture (i.e. deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, emergent architectures) and present brief descriptions of each study. Additionally, we discuss theoretical and practical issues of deep learning in bioinformatics and suggest future research directions. We believe that this review will provide valuable insights and serve as a starting point for researchers to apply deep learning approaches in their bioinformatics studies.",Generic

"Gene amplified in esophageal cancer 1 (GAEC1) expression and copy number changes are frequently associated with the pathogenesis of colorectal carcinomas. The current study aimed to identify the pathway and its transcriptional factors with which GAEC1 interacts within colorectal cancer, to gain a better understanding of the mechanics by which this gene exercises its effect on colorectal cancer. Two colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines (SW48 and SW480) and a nonneoplastic colon epithelial cell line (FHC) were transfected with GAEC1 to assess the oncogenic potential of GAEC1 overexpression. Multiple in vitro assays, including cell proliferation, wound healing, clonogenic, apoptosis, cell cycle, and extracellular flux, were performed. Western blot analysis was performed to identify potential gene-interaction partners of GAEC1 in vitro. Results showed that the overexpression of GAEC1 significantly increased cell proliferation, migration, and clonogenic potential ( P < 0.05) of colonic adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, GAEC1 portrayed its ability to influence mitochondrial respiration changes. The observations were in tandem with a significant increase in the expression of phosphorylated protein kinase B, forkhead box O3, and matrix metallopeptidase 9. Thus, GAEC1 has a role in regulating gene pathways, potentially in the Akt pathway. This could help in developing targeted therapies in the future.",Colon_Cancer

"Evidence emerging from many different types of experimental designs continues to support the concept that dietary habits and nutritional status play important roles in determining the risk of colorectal cancer. This field of investigation is nevertheless very confusing, particularly because longstanding hypotheses, such as the presumed protective effects of fruits, vegetables, and fiber, have recently been challenged by well-designed prospective trials. The search for individual components in the diet that convey protection continues: calcium, folate, selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids are the leading candidates in this regard. There is also growing interest in other plant-based compounds, so-called phytochemicals, although our understanding of their effects is quite rudimentary at present. Although the inconsistencies in this field make it tempting to minimize its import, there is little question that diet has a major impact on colorectal cancer risk; diligent attention to the rigorous conduct of studies and their interpretation will likely clarify these relationships over the next decade, much to the benefit of public health.",Colon_Cancer

The double innervation of the thyroid comes from the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. Injury rates during surgery are at 30% but can be minimized by upwardly preparing the thyroid vessels at the level of thyroid capsule. Several factors have been accused of increasing the risk of injury including age and tumor size. Our aim was to investigate of there is indeed any possible correlations between these factors and a possible increase in injury rates following thyroidectomy. Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. Statistical correlation was observed for a positive relationship between injury of the sympathetic nerve and thyroid malignancy surgery (p 2 = 74%) No statistical correlations were observed for a negative or positive relationship between injury of the sympathetic nerve and tumor size. There was also no statistically significant value observed for the correlation of the patients' age with the risk of sympathetic nerve injury (p = 0.388). Lack of significant correlation reported could be due to the small number of studies and great heterogeneity between them.,Thyroid_Cancer

Thyroid cancer accounts for just under 1 per cent of malignant disease. The prognosis varies from excellent with papillary carcinoma in young people to very poor in anaplastic carcinoma in the elderly. Modified rather than radical dissection of lymph nodes is indicated with well-differentiated tumours. The level of calcitonin in the blood is a sensitive marker for medullary carcinoma occurring either as sporadic or familial disease. The outcome of management in 7 patients with medullary carcinoma indicates that the prognosis is variable and that thyroidectomy is effective treatment.,Thyroid_Cancer
"Thyroid cancer is the most frequent endocrine neoplasm in the general population. Its incidence is 5-10/100,000 per year, with an annual death rate of 0.2-1.2/100,000 in men and 0.4-2.8/100,000 in women. In thalassaemia patients the frequency of this disease is unknown. In this paper we describe five cases of papillary thyroid cancer in thalassaemia patients followed at the Day Hospital for Thalassaemia and Haemoglobinopathies, in Ferrara, Italy. We consider the possible key role of iron as a carcinogenic agent and we also discuss the practical implications of our clinical observations.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Management of thyroid carcinoma relies upon the tumour cells maintaining the differentiated functions that are typical of normal thyroid follicular cells, such as: dependence upon thyrotropin for growth, production of thyroglobulin and effective transport of iodine. Likewise, differentiated thyroid carcinomas often exhibit an auspicious clinical behaviour with a slow rate of growth and low potential for invasion and distant metastasis. These features permit therapy of disseminated tumour, effective follow-up surveillance and the assumption of a good prognosis. As each of these features are lost, the opportunities for both disease status assessment and therapeutic intervention diminish accordingly. A major obstacle is our failure to define effective systemic treatments to replace radioiodine therapy, whose loss is consonant with the loss of iodine transport and retention. The extreme of undifferentiated clinical behaviour is epitomized by anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, a rare, terminally dedifferentiated malignancy that is rapidly and invariably fatal. It is important to be attuned to clinical clues suggesting the presence of dedifferentiated tumour and related prognostic signs. This allows the application of currently limited therapeutic options and defines the need for research to develop new systemic treatments.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Thyroid nodules are common clinically (prevalence, about 5%) and even more common on ultrasound examination (about 25%). About 5% of thyroid nodules are malignant. Most thyroid cancers are well-differentiated papillary or follicular tumours with an excellent prognosis (10-year survival, 80%-95%). The incidence of papillary thyroid cancer appears to be increasing on the east coast of Australia. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid is the most cost-effective diagnostic tool. Recommended initial management of all follicular carcinomas and of papillary carcinomas > 1.0 cm is total thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine ablation. Most patients should be managed postoperatively with doses of thyroid hormone sufficient to suppress plasma levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Recurrences can occur many years after initial therapy, and follow-up should be lifelong. Thyroid nodules are very common, but have a relatively low risk of malignancy",Thyroid_Cancer

"Myanmar transitioned to a civilian government in March, 2011. Although the democratic process has accelerated since then, many problems in the field of healthcare still exist. Since there is a limited overview on the healthcare in Myanmar, this article briefly describes the current states surrounding health services in Myanmar. According to the Census 2014, the population in the Republic of the Union of Myanmar was 51,410,000. The crude birth rate in the previous one year was estimated to be 18.9 per 1,000, giving the annual population growth rate of 0.89% between 2003 and 2014. The Ministry of Health reorganized into six departments. National non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations support healthcare, as well as international non-governmental organizations. Since hospital statistics by the government cover only public facilities, the information on private facilities is limited. Although there were not enough medical doctors (61 per 100,000 population), the number of medical students was reduced from 2,400 to 1,200 in 2012 to ensure the quality of medical education. The information on causes of death in the general population could not be retrieved, but some data was available from hospital statistics. Although the improvement was marked, the figures did not reach the levels set by Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5. A trial prepaid health insurance system started in July 2015, to be followed by evaluation one year later. There are many international donors, including the Japan International Cooperation Agency, supporting health in Myanmar.

"The incidence of thyroid cancer continues to increase, representing the 5th most common cancer type in the USA today (Sherman, Lancet 361(9356):501-11, 2003). The current study sought to analyze the global burden of thyroid cancer utilizing the publicly accessible GLOBOCAN database. An estimated 586,202 cases of thyroid cancer were reported in 2020, making thyroid cancer the 10th most common cancer worldwide. The majority of thyroid cancer cases occurred in countries with a high or very high Human Development Index (HDI), accounting for 91% of new cases. With respect to the World Health Organization (WHO) regions, the Western Pacific had the highest incidence of thyroid cancer accounting for 47.6% of cases despite representing only 25.4% of the world's population. Thyroid cancer incidence and mortality are expected to increase by 29.9% and 67%, respectively, by the year 2040. The African region is projected to experience the highest increase in both incidence (84.3%) and mortality (100.3%) over this time period. The results of our study demonstrate that the incidence and mortality of thyroid cancer vary by the geographic location and socio-economic status. Although the incidence was noted to be the highest in very high HDI countries and the Western Pacific region, mortality was noted to be disproportionately higher in the low HDI countries and African region. This may be due to discrepancies in access to care and/or environmental exposures such as ionizing radiation and iodine deficiency. Further measures are required to improve the outcomes from thyroid cancer regardless of the geographic location or socio-economic status.",Thyroid_Cancer

"DNA hypermethylation and mutations are key mechanisms for the downregulation of tumor suppressor genes. NotI-microarrays allowed us to detect hypermethylation and/or deletions in 180 NotI sites associated with 188 genes of human chromosome 3, in 24 paired (tumor/normal) colon samples. The most frequent aberrations (in more than 20% of tumor samples) were detected in the promoter regions of 20 genes. Expression and promoter methylation of these genes were analyzed using the data for paired colon samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas project. Three genes - ALDH1L1, PLCL2, and PPP2R3A - revealed a more than two-fold average decrease in expression and a negative correlation between mRNA level and promoter hypermethylation. The expression of these three genes was then evaluated in 30 paired colon samples by quantitative PCR. Frequent (in more than 60% of cases) and significant (5-9-fold on average) mRNA level decrease was found for each of the genes in the tumor samples. The results indicate a suppressor role of the ALDH1L1, PLCL2, and PPP2R3A genes in colon cancer, as well as functional significance of hypermethylation in the downregulation of these genes.",Colon_Cancer
"In small cell lung cancer (SCLC) combination chemotherapy including agents such as etoposide, teniposide, cisplatinum, carboplatin, and vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide, or ifosfamide continues to be the back-bone of therapy. The epipodophyllotoxin derivatives together with cisplatin or carboplatin are being used increasingly as part of the initial therapy, and these combinations are by most investigators considered standard therapy. Complete plus partial responses to combination therapy occur in 80-90% of all patients with a median duration of 9-12 months. The median survival in these studies is at present 11-18 months depending on the initial tumour stage. The 5-year survival data remain still around 5% including a small fraction of patients (2%) initially presenting with extensive disease. The tendency is to shorten the duration of treatment to 5-8 months. The results of intensifying the treatment with the use of haematopoietic growth factors continue to be disappointing, although these are not conclusive. With respect to squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma several meta-analyses indicate that there is a statistically significant, albeit small advantage favouring cisplatinum containing chemotherapy when added to surgery in stage I and II disease and to radiotherapy in stage III NSCLC. Similarly, cisplatin containing chemotherapy is statistically superior to best supportive care in stage IV disease. The results from the latter analyses are significant at 1 and 2 years, respectively, but not at 3 and 5 years of survival. These data must, however, be considered in the light of their clinical relevance and of the balance between quality of life, toxicity, and cost of chemotherapy. The results of recently published phase III trials in stage III disease support the use of combined modalities of chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone. For both small cell and non-small cell lung cancer a number of new agents have been evaluated over the last 2 to 3 years and among those navelbine, topotecan, gemcitabine, and taxanes (taxol and taxotere) have yielded the most encouraging results.

"It is not uncommon for micrometastases to be detected in the regional lymph nodes in patients with thyroid cancer. It remains controversial whether lymph node dissection improves patient outcomes. According to the clinical guidelines edited by the Japan Association of Endocrine Surgeons and Japanese Society of Thyroid Surgeons, there is no evidence that prophylactic central compartment dissection improves the cause-specific survival of papillary carcinoma patients. However, it is recommended at initial surgery because reoperation for recurrence in this compartment may induce severe complications. On the other hand, prophylactic lateral node dissection can reduce the risk of recurrence to the nodes and improve disease-free survival rates, although evidence is lacking on whether it improves cause-specific survival. Surgeons should be aware that pathologically identified metastatic lymph nodes are less common than actual metastatic lesions and determine the disease entity of ectopic thyroid tissue in lymph nodes.

"Serum thyroglobulin (Tg) was measured in 274 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer; 266 had previous thyroidectomy, which had been followed by ablative iodine-131 in 183 cases. Neither the presence nor the titre of anti-Tg antibodies appeared to affect Tg assays. Serum Tg reflected the presence or absence of cancer in 83% of 164 patients not receiving thyroxine (T4). This concordance improved to 97.5% in 158 patients tested while receiving T4. 34 patients in remission were tested both on and off T4 therapy; in all these patients the Tg level when receiving T4 was less than 5 micrograms/l. In 19 of 21 patients with cancer T4 treatment did not suppress Tg. Serum Tg thus provides an excellent marker for the presence or absence of thyroid cancer in patients taking T4, even if anti-Tg antibodies are present. It is proposed that monitoring of patients by assay of serum Tg should supplant routine assessment by radioactive-iodine scans of the neck or whole body.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Vandetanib, an orally active, small-molecule, multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, demonstrates potent inhibitory activity against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2 and -3, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the rearranged during transfection (RET) tyrosine kinase receptor. The large (n=331), randomized, double-blind, multinational ZETA trial compared vandetanib at a dosage of 300 mg once daily with placebo in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic, hereditary or sporadic, medullary thyroid cancer. During a median follow-up period of 2 years, vandetanib demonstrated statistically significant clinical benefits over placebo with respect to the primary endpoint, namely progression-free survival (PFS), and a range of secondary endpoints, which included objective response rate, disease control rate, time to worsening of pain and calcitonin biochemical response rate. The PFS benefit with vandetanib was mostly consistent across patient subgroups based on baseline characteristics and disease status. Although the correlation between RET mutation status and clinical outcome could not be clearly evaluated in this trial, it is notable that, among patients with sporadic disease, vandetanib not only demonstrated a PFS benefit in the subgroup confirmed as having a RET mutation, but also in the subgroup for whom the RET mutation status was unknown. Vandetanib was generally well tolerated in the ZETA trial; the majority of adverse events were manageable according to standard clinical practice alone or in combination with vandetanib dose reductions.

In this article data from in vitro, animal and human studies on the intraluminal effects of calcium, on its effects on colorectal epithelium and on the association between calcium intake and colorectal cancer are reviewed. It is concluded that at present it should be advised to bring dietary calcium intake into agreement with general dietary guidelines, but that high expectations of extra calcium as an effective mode of colon cancer prevention should not be encouraged.",Colon_Cancer

"Biodiversity is being lost at an unprecedented rate on Earth. As a first step to more effectively combat this process we need efficient methods to monitor biodiversity changes. Recent technological advance can provide powerful tools (e.g. camera traps, digital acoustic recorders, satellite imagery, social media records) that can speed up the collection of biological data. Nevertheless, the processing steps of the raw data served by these tools are still painstakingly slow. A new computer technology, deep learning based artificial intelligence, might, however, help. In this short and subjective review I oversee recent technological advances used in conservation biology, highlight problems of processing their data, shortly describe deep learning technology and show case studies of its use in conservation biology. Some of the limitations of the technology are also highlighted.",Generic

"As there have been advances in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, exciting developments have also been achieved in the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer. At the same time, more questions have been raised, and some controversies remain. The results of the MOSAIC trial demonstrated the benefit of adding oxaliplatin to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (FOLFOX) in adjuvant therapy for stage II and III disease, but the optimal duration of therapy and the management of toxicities remain to be resolved. Capecitabine is at least equivalent to the Mayo Clinic bolus 5-FU and leucovorin regimen in the adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer with a lower incidence profile of adverse events, allowing additional options for patients and physicians. Routine adjuvant systemic therapy in all patients with stage II colon cancer is still debatable. Although a statistically significant advantage for adjuvant treatment in stage II disease was shown for the first time from a large randomized study (QUASAR), the subsets of patients who truly benefit from therapy need to be identified. The application of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics in adjuvant therapy for colorectal cancer will help to distinguish those patients with risk factors and to guide individualized therapy.",Colon_Cancer
"Activin and TGF share SMAD signaling and colon cancers can inactivate either pathway alone or simultaneously. The differential effects of activin and TGF signaling in colon cancer have not been previously dissected. A key downstream target of TGF signaling is the cdk2 inhibitor p21 (p21(cip1/waf1)). Here, we evaluate activin-specific effects on p21 regulation and resulting functions. We find that TGF is a more potent inducer of growth suppression, while activin is a more potent inducer of apoptosis. Further, growth suppression and apoptosis by both ligands are dependent on SMAD4. However, activin downregulates p21 protein in a SMAD4-independent fashion in conjunction with increased ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation to enhance migration, while TGF upregulates p21 in a SMAD4-dependent fashion to affect growth arrest. Activin-induced growth suppression and cell death are dependent on p21, while activin-induced migration is counteracted by p21. Further, primary colon cancers show differential p21 expression consistent with their ACVR2/TGFBR2 receptor status. In summary, we report p21 as a differentially affected activin/TGF target and mediator of ligand-specific functions in colon cancer, which may be exploited for future risk stratification and therapeutic intervention.",Colon_Cancer
"Soft robotics is an exciting field of science and technology that enables robots to manipulate objects with human-like dexterity. Soft robots can handle delicate objects with care, access remote areas, and offer realistic feedback on their handling performance. However, increased dexterity and mechanical compliance of soft robots come with the need for accurate control of the position and shape of these robots. Therefore, soft robots must be equipped with sensors for better perception of their surroundings, location, force, temperature, shape, and other stimuli for effective usage. This review highlights recent progress in sensing feedback technologies for soft robotic applications. It begins with an introduction to actuation technologies and material selection in soft robotics, followed by an in-depth exploration of various types of sensors, their integration methods, and the benefits of multimodal sensing, signal processing, and control strategies. A short description of current market leaders in soft robotics is also included in the review to illustrate the growing demands of this technology. By examining the latest advancements in sensing feedback technologies for soft robots, this review aims to highlight the potential of soft robotics and inspire innovation in the field.",Generic
"The prognoses of T4 lung cancer patients treated surgically were investigated in 76 patients. Extended resection was performed in 21 patients, palliative resection in 21 and exploratory thoracotomy in 34. Although the five-year survival of the extended resection group did not differ significantly from that obtained in the exploratory thoracotomy group, the mean survival time of the extended resection group was 3.1 months longer than that of the exploratory thoracotomy group. Two patients who had undergone resection for left atrial involvement, survived for two years or more, and a T4N0 patient with squamous cell carcinoma, in whom resection for aortic involvement was carried out, died from an unrelated disease after 15 months. Two patients with pleural dissemination, who underwent panpleuropneumonectomy, survived for two years.

"Reports of tumor regression after infection date back as far as 1550 bc. In the twentieth century, Dr. William Coley, witnessing regression of a malignant tumor in one of his patients after a bacterial infection, developed the first cancer treatment vaccine derived from killed bacteria, with some reported success. However, despite decades of research, no specific, active tumor vaccine has been approved for the treatment of cancer. In lung cancer, initial attempts to modulate the immune system with nonspecific therapies were unsuccessful. However, more sophisticated specific vaccines have now been developed, and an increasing number are being evaluated in randomized phase 3 trials, raising hopes that vaccines may be an additional novel therapy for patients with lung cancer. This article reviews the following seven vaccines, which have entered randomized trials: L-BLP25 (Stimuvax), BEC-2, 1E10, PF-3512676 (Promune), melanoma-associated antigen A3 immunotherapeutic, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-transduced allogeneic cancer cellular immunotherapy, and belagenpumatucel-L (Lucanix).",Lung_Cancer
"Thyroid cancer is common but rarely deadly. Unfortunately, when the disease becomes refractory to radioactive iodine (RAI), few effective treatment options remain. This situation is changing, however, with the availability of multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Cabozantanib and vandetanib, both recently FDA-approved for advanced or metastatic disease, have more than doubled progression-free survival in medullary thyroid cancer. New agents in the pipeline may yield even better outcomes, as discussed by Dr. Robert I. Haddad at the NCCN 18th Annual Conference.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Colorectal cancer is a common neoplasia with high morbidity and mortality. With endoscopy it is possible to identify its precursor lesion, the adenoma, and early localized cancer. Early detection and removal of adenomas can reduce the incidence and mortality of this disease. Studies using fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and sigmoidoscopy for screening asymptomatic patients demonstrate a reduction in mortality from colorectal cancer. Colonoscopy, however, has the highest yield for detecting polyps. Most authorities and organizations now recommend screening the asymptomatic population over age 50 for colorectal neoplasia. The estimated cost of colon cancer screening is well within the benchmark figure of $40,000 per year of life saved, which is considered by the government to be cost effective. Controversies still exist regarding which colon cancer screening strategy is the most sensitive, specific, acceptable to the population, and cost effective. The American Cancer Society recommends a combination of FOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy, but some experts believe that a one-time colonoscopy at age 60 may be a more cost-effective method. If the costs of colonoscopy are reduced, it is more cost effective than other techniques. Colonoscopy also may help to stratify at-risk patients, and those with negative initial colonoscopy may not need further screening. Advances in molecular biology may provide markers for screening or identifying people who are at high risk for colorectal neoplasia. This development may allow screening to be directed at high-risk groups.",Colon_Cancer
"Analysis was carried out according to stage and tissue type of 392 consecutive cases of lung cancer diagnosed at David Grant Medical Center between 1960 and 1974. Biphasic survival curves were described with a variable primary phase and a constant (1.1 percent per month) secondary phase. Survival was found to correlate both to histology and stage. The best survival was found in stage I bronchoalveolar carcinoma. Even in the more favorable categories a leveling off of survival was not found. This study strongly suggests that surgical treatment of lung cancer, while beneficial, cannot expect to be considered as a curative procedure in more than 10 percent of cases. Radiotherapy did not prolong survival.",Lung_Cancer
"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, and the majority of diagnoses are made in former smokers. Although avoidance of tobacco abuse and smoking cessation clearly will have the greatest impact on lung cancer development, effective chemoprevention could prove to be more effective than treatment of established, advanced-stage disease. Chemoprevention is the use of dietary or pharmaceutical agents to reverse or block the carcinogenic process and has been successfully applied to common malignancies other than lung (including recent reports on the prevention of breast cancer in high-risk individuals). Despite previous studies in lung cancer chemoprevention failing to identify effective agents, our ability to define the highest-risk populations and the understanding of lung tumor and premalignant biology continue to make advances. Squamous cell carcinogenesis in the bronchial epithelium starts with normal epithelium and progresses through hyperplasia, metaplasia, dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ to invasive cancer. Precursor lesions also have been identified for adenocarcinoma, and these premalignant lesions are targeted by chemopreventive agents in current and future trials. Chemopreventive agents can currently only be recommended as part of well-designed clinical trials, and multiple trials have recently been completed or are enrolling subjects.",Lung_Cancer
"Thyroid cancer is one of the rarest forms of cancer, and yet there are wide variations in the degree of malignancy, ranging from the most rapidly fatal to the relatively benign. This difference depends almost entirely on the histological type. A ""pool"" of individuals with occult thyroid carcinomas (in the vast majority of the papillary type) is probably present in most populations even at a young age. Large differences in the estimated frequency of cancer at this site can therefore be caused by variation in diagnostic intensity. Data on changing trends of incidence and mortality are thus subject to reservation, depending on the degree to which they have been influenced by changing diagnostic criteria and the precision of histopathological description. Nevertheless, there is evidence that mortality is slowly falling, whereas incidence is increasing, in several countries. This chapter considers the upward temporal trends of incidence and substantially stable mortality rates for thyroid carcinoma in the past three decades and attempts to interpret these trends in the light of concurrent changes in diagnostic standards and histological classification. Attention will also be drawn to the public health implications of the recent intensive detection and treatment of occult thyroid carcinomas.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Telemedicine is extremely useful when distance could hinder diagnostic procedures, disease management, or when severe side-effects may occur in patients not within easy reach of medical care and requiring prompt action and specific therapies. Telemedicine has been successfully adopted in the management of chronic patients, particularly in those with cardiologic or oncologic diseases. In the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer, requiring long-term check-ups and visits as well as administration of high doses of levothyroxine (TSH - thyroid-stimulating hormone - suppression), also in elderly patients, telemedicine seems particularly indicated. Moreover, these distant monitoring techniques could not only reduce long-term management costs but also considerably decrease cardiovascular risks associated with these patients. The present review aims to provide some general information on telemedicine and its possible fields of action with regard to distant monitoring of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma.",Thyroid_Cancer

Accordingly, RET protein has become a promising molecular target for cancer treatment.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Extensive research in genetics and genomics has revealed that lung cancer is a physiologically complex and genetically heterogeneous disease. Although molecular targets that can yield favorable response have been identified, those targets cannot be exploited due to the lack of suitable drug carriers. Furthermore, lung cancer often is diagnosed at an advanced stage when the disease has metastasized. Conventional treatments are not effective for treating metastatic lung cancer. Targeted therapeutics while beneficial has challenges that include poor tumor-targeting, off-target effects, and development of resistance to therapy. Therefore, improved drug delivery systems that can deliver drugs specifically to tumor will produce improved treatment outcomes. Exosomes have a natural ability to carry functional biomolecules, such as small RNAs, DNAs, and proteins, in their lumen. This property makes exosomes attractive for use in drug delivery and molecular diagnosis. Moreover, exosomes can be attached to nanoparticles and used for high precision imaging. Exosomes are now considered an important component in liquid biopsy assessments, which are useful for detecting cancers, including lung cancer. Several studies are currently underway to develop methods of exploiting exosomes for use as efficient drug delivery vehicles and to develop novel diagnostic modalities. This chapter summarizes the current status of exosome studies with regard to their use as theranostics in lung cancer. Examples from other cancers have also been cited to illustrate the extensive applicability of exosomes to therapy and diagnosis.",Lung_Cancer

It will give one (personal) view of what soft actuators and robots are, and how this class of soft devices fits into the more highly developed field of conventional ""hard"" robotics. It will also suggest how and why soft robotics is more than simply a minor technical ""tweak"" on hard robotics and propose a unique role for chemistry, and materials science, in this field.

"In molecular pathology, predictive biomarkers identify which patients are likely to respond to targeted drugs. These therapeutic agents block specific molecules directly involved in cancer growth, dedifferentiation and progression. Until few years ago, the only targeted drugs available for advanced thyroid cancer included multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mainly targeting the MAPK pathway and the angiogenic signaling. The administration of these drugs does not necessarily require a molecular characterization of tumors to assess the presence of predictive alterations. However, the availability of new selective targeted drugs for thyroid cancer patients is changing the diagnostic strategies for the molecular characterization of these tumors. The search for targetable alterations can be performed directly on tumor tissue by using a variety of methodologies, depending also on the number and type of alterations to test (i.e. single nucleotide variation or gene rearrangement). Herein, a comprehensive review of the currently available targeted treatments for thyroid cancer, related predictive markers and testing methodologies is provided.",Thyroid_Cancer

Continued TSH suppressive levothyroxine therapy is only recommended in high-risk patients. In contrast, metastatic radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancers have a poor prognosis and may benefit from multidisciplinary treatment concepts including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Due to its complexity, management of thyroid cancer patients should be performed in close collaboration with a specialized thyroid cancer team.",Thyroid_Cancer

"The cause of the high incidence of methane producers in patients with colorectal cancer is not clear. A total of 270 individuals were studied for methane production, using an end-expiratory breath sampling technique. They were divided into eight groups: 156 healthy controls (group 1); 47 patients with colorectal cancer (group 2); 36 patients (34 of them included in the previous group) after resection of the tumor (group 3); 7 (also included in group 2) with nonresectable tumor (group 4); 29 with nonmalignant diseases of the colon (group 5); 12 with extensive ulcerative colitis (group 6); 12 with ulcerative proctosigmoiditis (group 7); and 12 with colonic polyposis (group 8). Significantly more patients (91.4%) with colorectal cancer in group 2 produced methane than either healthy controls (42.9%) (p less than 0.001) or patients with benign diseases of the colon (41.3%) (p less than 0.001). In 36 patients (group 3) in whom the cancer was resected, the incidence of methane producers fell to 47.2%, similar to the control group, but significantly different from group 2 (p less than 0.001). The percentage of methane producers in patients operated on, but with unresectable cancer, remained very high (87.7%). A significantly higher proportion of patients with extensive ulcerative colitis (group 6) and colonic polyposis (group 7) produced methane than patients with ulcerative proctosigmoiditis (group 7), benign diseases of the colon (group 5), and healthy controls (p less than 0.05).

"Diet and lifestyle modification offers means of reducing risk of developing colon cancer. Current data suggest that consuming a Western style diet, that is, one high in meat, refined grains, and sugar and low in vegetables and fiber, may contribute to risk of colon cancer. There also are data to support a reduction in colon cancer risk from consuming high levels of calcium and folate. Energy balance and maintaining an appropriate body weight have been associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer. An important part of the energy balance equation is physical activity. High levels of physical activity have consistently been identified as being associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer. It is estimated that 13% of colon cancer can be attributed to being physically inactive, 12% of colon cancer can be attributed to eating a Western style diet, and 8% of colon cancer can be attributed to having a first degree relative with colorectal cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Colorectal cancer is a major health problem in the western world and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Diet makes a significant contribution to the disease, with high fat, low fibre diets correlating positively with a high incidence of colorectal cancer. Intracellular polyamine concentrations and ornithine decarboxylase activity are both increased in colorectal cancer tissue and in premalignant polyps. Measurement of the polyamine content of serum and urine of individuals has been proposed as a diagnostic marker of malignancy but a number of false positives make this idea untenable. There may, however, still be a role for the measurement of urinary polyamine content as a means of monitoring the efficacy of therapy. Inhibition of polyamine metabolism by polyamine analogues or by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be useful in the chemotherapy and/or chemoprevention of colorectal cancer. Preliminary results suggest that a low polyamine diet might be helpful as part of a health care plan for cancer patients.",Colon_Cancer
"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the number one cancer killer and its early detection can reduce mortality. Accumulating evidences suggest an etiopathogenic role of microorganisms in lung tumorigenesis. Certain bacteria are found to be associated with NSCLC. Herein we evaluated the potential use of microbiome as biomarkers for the early detection of NSCLC. We used droplet digital PCR to analyze 25 NSCLC-associated bacterial genera in 31 lung tumor and the paired noncancerous lung tissues and sputum of 17 NSCLC patients and ten cancer-free smokers. Of the bacterial genera, four had altered abundances in lung tumor tissues, while five were aberrantly abundant in sputum of NSCLC patients compared with their normal counterparts (all p < 0.05). Acidovorax and Veillonella were further developed as a panel of sputum biomarkers that could diagnose lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with 80% sensitivity and 89% specificity. The use of Capnocytophaga as a sputum biomarker identified lung adenocarcinoma (AC) with 72% sensitivity and 85% specificity. The use of Acidovorax as a sputum biomarker had 63% sensitivity and 96% specificity for distinguishing between SCC and AC, the two major types of NSCLC. The sputum biomarkers were further validated for the diagnostic values in a different cohort of 69 NSCLC cases and 79 cancer-free controls. Sputum microbiome might provide noninvasive biomarkers for the early detection and classification of NSCLC.",Lung_Cancer
"Colon cancer is a major human cancer accounting for about a tenth of all cancer cases thus making it among the top three cancers in terms of incidence as well as mortality. Metastasis to distant organs, particularly to liver, is the primary reason for associated mortality. Chemokines, the chemo-attractants for various immune cells, have increasingly been reported to be involved in cancer initiation and progression, including in colon cancer. Here we discuss the available knowledge on the role of several chemokines, such as, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL8 in colon cancer progression. CCL20 is one chemokine with emerging evidence for its role in influencing colon cancer tumor microenvironment through the documents effects on fibroblasts, macrophages and immune cells. We focus on CCL20 and its receptor CCR6 as promising factors that affect multiple levels of colon cancer progression. They interact with several cytokines and TLR receptors leading to increased aggressiveness, as supported by multitude of evidence from in vitro, in vivo studies as well as human patient samples. CCL20-CCR6 bring about their biological effects through regulation of several signaling pathways, including, ERK and NF- B pathways, in addition to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Signaling involving CCL20-CCR6 has profound effect on colon cancer hepatic metastasis. Combined with elevated CCL20 levels in colon tumors and metastatic patients, the above information points to a need for further evaluation of chemokines as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers.",Colon_Cancer

In this comment, we explain why the idea of literacy appeals to policy makers in the advanced industrial nations. But we also show that the narrow skill set laid out by economists does not satisfy the politically inclusive definition of literacy that literacy studies fought for. We identify several channels through which people engage with ideas about finance and demonstrate that not all forms of literacy will lead people to the educational content prescribed by academic economists. We argue that truly financial literate people can defy the demands of financial theory and financial institutions.",Generic
"Until recently, bacteria have been studied in terms of their roles in infectious diseases and mainly by using isolation and culture methods. However, in practice, many bacteria existing on the earth are difficult to isolate and culture, and thus only a limited number of them have been studied to date. On the other hand, in 2005, the next-generation sequencing technology became generally available, and since then genomic analysis of bacterial flora has become widespread. As a result, it has been revealed that the lower respiratory tract, which was previously thought to be sterile, in fact has bacterial flora (a microbiome) with a high level of biodiversity. In addition, it has been found that various diseases develop and worsen depending on the balance of the bacterial flora, and in recent years, a relationship has been established between various disorders. Recent research on cancer-associated microbial communities has elucidated the reciprocal interactions among bacteria, tumors and immune cells, the bacterial pathways associated with induction of oncogenesis, and their translational significance. Nevertheless, despite the increasing evidence showing that dysbiosis is associated with lung oncogenesis, the detailed mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Microorganisms seem to trigger tumor initiation and progression, presumably through the production of bacterio-toxins and other pro-inflammatory factors.

"Our purpose is to demonstrate that some human colon cancer cells are able to express the same differentiation features as normal intestinal epithelial cells and to report experimental data which suggest that these particular cells are spontaneously resistant and adaptable to anticancer drugs. The concept of normal differentiation of colon cancer cells is supported by observations made with two cultured cell lines, Caco-2 and HT-29. The cell line Caco-2 expresses spontaneously and homogeneously an enterocytic differentiation. The cell line HT-29 is heterogeneous as it contains a small proportion (< 5%) of differentiated cells of either enterocytic or mucus-secreting type. Homogeneous populations of differentiated HT-29 cells of either type have been isolated by pressure selection. In order to investigate whether the pressure associated with anti-cancer drugs would result in the selection of differentiated populations, HT-29 cells were cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil. The resulting resistant populations were found to be totally differentiated. This supports the view that the small proportion of parental cells which are able to differentiate are also able to spontaneously resist to drug pressure. These results imply that the concept of cellular differentiation should be considered by pathologists. They also imply that basic research should be developed in order to unravel which mechanisms of drug resistance are specifically associated with the ability of the cells to differentiate.",Colon_Cancer

In this review, the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical signs and treatment options for the clinically important paraneoplastic syndromes in lung cancer are discussed.",Lung_Cancer
Thyroid cancer is the most frequently diagnosed endocrine cancer and causes more deaths than all other endocrine cancers combined. Research findings support the concept that a subpopulation of thyroid cancer cells displays properties characteristic of stem cells. These putative cancer-forming entities drive tumorigenesis as a result of their dual ability to undergo self-renewal and to differentiate into various types of cancer cells; they also mediate metastasis and are resistant to the effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This Review discusses the cellular origin of thyroid cancer and the properties of the thyroid cancer stem cell niche. The article critically evaluates the methods used to identify molecular markers expressed by thyroid-cancer-initiating cells and outlines prospective therapeutic strategies to directly target these cells. Stem-cell technology offers an unprecedented opportunity to investigate these crucial cancer stem cell populations and to advance understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control disease processes. Such knowledge could potentially lead to the development of more effective and safer treatment regimens for late-stage thyroid cancer than are currently available.,Thyroid_Cancer
"One hundred forty-eight cases of colon carcinoma were subjected to further pathologic study. Survival was correlated with stage and grade of the tumor and with the number of involved lymph nodes. In addition, cases were assessed as to the extent of local chronic inflammatory reaction about the lesion and the degree of sinus histiocytosis in draining lymph nodes. A correlation was possible between grading, staging, extent of lymph node involvement, and survival. A substantial difference in five-year survival was shown when local inflammatory reaction was present and when sinus histiocytosis was observed. The presence of both of these factors further improved survival. An adequate evaluation of these factors, both individually and in combination, should improve our ability to assess prognosis in colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"We describe herein dermatomyositis (DM) associated with thyroid cancer in a 54-year-old woman. She was resistant to corticosteroids at first, but removal of the coexisting cancer resulted in improvement of DM. Reports on the association of DM with thyroid cancer are very few. However, recently, increasing incidence of thyroid cancer is pointed out. It is thought that increasing incidence reflects increased detection of subclinical disease due to increased diagnostic scrutiny, not an increase in the true occurrence of thyroid cancer. Thus, DM associated with thyroid cancer may be more frequent than we generally expected. We recommend that thyroid studies should be included in cancer investigations, particularly in DM cases resistant to corticosteroids.",Thyroid_Cancer
Recent molecular studies have described a number of abnormalities associated with the progression and dedifferentiation of thyroid carcinoma. These distinct molecular events are often associated with specific stages of tumor development.

"We reviewed the descriptive epidemiology of thyroid cancer using data from the Cancer Registry of the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland, a consistently well-surveilled population with relatively high rates of the disease, between 1974 and 1998, on the basis of a total of 596 registered cases. Overall thyroid cancer incidence tended to increase moderately in both genders over the 25-year period considered, to reach rates of 5.4 and 2.0 per 100,000 (world standard) in females and males, respectively. There were also changes in histologic classification, with some increases in papillary neoplasms and corresponding decreases in other and unclassified ones. Ten-year relative survival rates for cases diagnosed in 1988-1993 were 94% for papillary cancer in females and 69% in males, and 59% for follicular cancer in females. Corresponding figures were 12% for undifferentiated, and 31% for other and unspecified neoplasms in both sexes combined. Multivariate analysis confirmed the unfavorable influence of male gender (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.9), elderly age (HR = 16.5 for age > or = 65 vs. < 45 years) and undifferentiated histotype (HR = 3.5 vs. papillary) on the long-term prognosis of thyroid cancer, and showed no consistent evidence of appreciably improved prognosis over more recent calendar periods.",Thyroid_Cancer

Our study examines whether homozygosity is associated with an increased risk of TC and searches for novel recessively acting disease loci.",Thyroid_Cancer

Some thyroid cancers are or become dedifferentiated, and they become refractory to efficacy-proven conventional therapies such as radioiodine ablation therapy and thyrotropin (TSH)-suppressive therapy.

"We present an automated method for measuring media bias. Inferring which newspaper published a given article, based only on the frequencies with which it uses different phrases, leads to a conditional probability distribution whose analysis lets us automatically map newspapers and phrases into a bias space. By analyzing roughly a million articles from roughly a hundred newspapers for bias in dozens of news topics, our method maps newspapers into a two-dimensional bias landscape that agrees well with previous bias classifications based on human judgement. One dimension can be interpreted as traditional left-right bias, the other as establishment bias. This means that although news bias is inherently political, its measurement need not be.",Generic
Bronchoscopic techniques have seen significant advances in the last decade. The development and refinement of different types of endobronchial ultrasound and navigation systems have led to improved diagnostic yield and lung cancer staging capabilities. The complication rate of these minimally invasive procedures is extremely low as compared to traditional transthoracic needle biopsy and surgical sampling. These advances augment the safe array of methods utilized in the work up and management algorithms of lung cancer.,Lung_Cancer
"The objectives for this longitudinal study were to: (a) compare colon cancer patients' and their spouses' appraisal of illness, resources, concurrent stress, and adjustment during the first year following surgery; (b) examine the influence of gender (male vs female) and role (patient vs spouse caregiver) on study variables; (c) assess the degree of correlation between patients' and spouses' adjustments; and (d) identify factors that affect adjustment to the illness. Fifty-six couples were interviewed at one week post diagnosis, and at 60 days and one year post surgery. Based on a cognitive-appraisal model of stress, the Smilkstein Stress Scale was used to measure concurrent stress; the Family APGAR, Social Support Questionnaire, and Dyadic Adjustment Scale were used to measure social resources; the Beck Hopelessness Scale and Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scales were used to measure appraisal of illness; and the Brief Symptom Inventory and Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale were used to measure psychosocial adjustment. Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance indicated that spouses reported significantly more emotional distress and less social support than patients. Gender differences were found, with women reporting more distress, more role problems, and less marital satisfaction, regardless of whether they were patient or spouse. Both patients and spouses reported decreases in their family functioning and social support, but also decreases in emotional distress over time. Moderately high autocorrelations and modest intercorrelations were found among and between patients' and spouses' adjustment scores over time. The strongest predictors of patients' role adjustment problems were hopelessness and spouses' role problems. The strongest predictors of spouses' role problems were spouses' own baseline role problems and level of marital satisfaction. Interventions need to start early in the course of illness, be family-focused, and identify the couples at risk of poorer adjustment to colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer

"Data on 117 male patients with thyroid cancer (1994-2004) have been assessed. It was found that thyroid cancer often engenders in the nodular formation it males. Early-stage cancers were detected in 63 cases (54.9%). Radiotherapy as a component of combined treatment was the most popular modality (43.2%), due to the malignant character of locally-advancer tumor. Ten-year survival was in 65.2%, while, in 11.9%, radical surgery was not indicated.",Thyroid_Cancer
"In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the identification of oncogenic driver mutations led to the definition of different clinical entities with different therapeutic opportunities, as demonstrated in patients harboring EGF receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocations. Human EGFR2 (or HER2) has an established role as a prognostic and predictive factor in breast cancer. Although HER2 deregulation, including overexpression, amplification and mutation, has been described in NSCLC, its role as a therapy biomarker remains undefined. In the last few years, there has been a growing interest on HER2 mutation, with few anecdotal or retrospective studies suggesting a relevant role for this biomarker. This review discusses the prognostic and predictive impact of HER2 deregulation and the clinical implications of anti-HER2 strategies in NSCLC.",Lung_Cancer
"Whereas preemptive screening for the presence of lymph node and lung metastases is standard-of-care in thyroid cancer patients, bone metastases are less well studied and are often neglected in thyroid cancer patient surveillance. Bone metastases in thyroid cancer are, however, independently associated with poor/worse prognosis with a median overall survival from detection of only 4 years despite an otherwise excellent prognosis for the vast majority of thyroid cancer patients. In this review we summarize the state of current knowledge as pertinent to bony metastatic disease in thyroid cancer, including clinical implications, impacts on patient function and quality of life, pathogenesis, and therapeutic opportunities, proposing approaches to patient care accordingly. In particular, bone metastasis pathogenesis appears to reflect cooperatively between cancer and the bone microenvironment creating a ""vicious cycle"" of bone destruction rather than due exclusively to tumor invasion into bone. Additionally, bone metastases are more frequent in follicular and medullary thyroid cancers, requiring closer bone surveillance in patients with these histologies. Emerging data also suggest that treatments such as multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) can be less effective in controlling bone, as opposed to other (e.g. lung), metastases in thyroid cancers, making special attention to bone critical even in the setting of active MKI therapy. Although locoregional therapies including surgery, radiotherapy and ablation play important roles in palliation, antiresorptive agents including bisphosphonates and denosumab appear individually to delay and/or lessen skeletal morbidity and complications, with dosing frequency of every 3 months appearing optimal; their early application should therefore be strongly considered.",Thyroid_Cancer
"With the current trend of alarming rise in obesity rates, the health impacts of excess weight will become more apparent. While an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus has been well documented, the association between obesity and carcinogenesis is just being appreciated and is receiving increasing attention. The current review focuses on the evidence linking thyroid cancer with obesity. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence that obesity can predispose to an increased risk of thyroid cancer in both men and women. This population-based association is mainly explained at a biological level through specific obesity-related endocrinopathies.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Over the past 30 years, rectal cancer surgery has been standardized by total mesorectal excision. More recently, some have suggested that colon cancer surgery should be standardized by complete mesocolic excision (CME) with central vascular ligation (CVL), especially in Western countries. Surgeons undertaking CME with CVL report optimal outcomes. Sharp dissection within the embryological plane and high vascular ligation at the vessel origin are essential. In Japan, a similar concept, D3 dissection, has been adopted for decades. Although both surgical procedures are similar, distinct differences exist. Some surgeons are confused about the principles and practice of these two procedures. As well as overviewing the theory behind CME with CVL and D3 dissection, the technical details of both procedures are described.",Colon_Cancer
67 segments of rectum and sigmoid removed surgically because of carcinoma were examined: the surface of intestinal mucosa stained with methylene-blue was studied in order to determine the number and localization of focal changes in the macroscopically unchanged areas. Colon microscopy was performed clinically in 24 patients with carcinoma of the rectum and in 24 control individuals. 28 hyperplastic polyps and 1037 microscopic hyperplastic foci were found in operative material. An active metabolism is established by means of electron autoradiography in the cells of hyperplastic focus. Areas of dysplastic epithelium were rarely found in big hyperplastic polyps. Areas of diffuse hyperplasia (transitional mucosa) with crypt deepening and presence of a high number of goblet cells were found near tumour. A certain role of hyperplastic processes in carcinogenesis is forwarded. Numerous microscopic changes in the mucosa epithelium may testify against the carcinoma development de novo.,Colon_Cancer

"Thyroid cancer is the fifth most common cancer in women in the USA, and an estimated over 62 000 new cases occurred in men and women in 2015. The incidence continues to rise worldwide. Differentiated thyroid cancer is the most frequent subtype of thyroid cancer and in most patients the standard treatment (surgery followed by either radioactive iodine or observation) is effective. Patients with other, more rare subtypes of thyroid cancer-medullary and anaplastic-are ideally treated by physicians with experience managing these malignancies. Targeted treatments that are approved for differentiated and medullary thyroid cancers have prolonged progression-free survival, but these drugs are not curative and therefore are reserved for patients with progressive or symptomatic disease.",Thyroid_Cancer
"TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) plays a critical role in the regulation of innate immune responses and adaptive immune responses. Though recent studies indicate that TRAF6 is involved in cancer, its precise role in cancer including colon cancer has not been extensively investigated and remains largely unknown. The purpose of this work is to determine the expression of TRAF6 in colon cancer as well as the possible role of it in proliferation and apoptosis of colon cancer cells. Fifty colon cancer tissues paired with their adjacent non-cancerous tissues were analyzed. TRAF6 expression is upregulated in cancers (P=0.000), which is correlated with tumor grades (P=0.012). The tumor tissue-array analysis also indicates that expression of TRAF6 is upregulated in colon cancer (P=0.000), but the TRAF6 upregulation has no association with patients' survival rate (P=0.055). We found that knockdown of TRAF6 blocks proliferation of colon cancer cells through cyclin D1. Different from other reports, in our experiments knockdown of TRAF6 alone has little effect on survival of colon cancer cells examined. Knockdown of TRAF6 sensitizes the cells to treatment of the conventional anti-cancer drugs 5-fluorouracil and etoposide. Thus, inhibition of TRAF6 may improve the therapeutic treatment of these drugs. Together, our data suggest that TRAF6 promotes proliferation of colon cancer cells and it may serve as a potential target for therapy of colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer

"In summary, PTC is common, although it rarely results in disease-specific mortality. It is being diagnosed increasingly in the subclinical phase as a result of enhanced ultrasound imaging and more aggressive surveillance of smaller thyroid nodules. US-guided FNA is the ""gold-standard"" for diagnosis. Although controversy continues about the appropriate surgical management of PTC, total thyroidectomy is usually indicated given the frequent multicentricity and metastases of the disease, which in turn, necessitates adjuvant RAI and careful surveillance. An enhanced prognostic classification could better guide initial surgical therapy, standardize surveillance, and reduce the risk of recurrent and persistent disease. Research efforts should focus on the genetic and molecular underpinnings of PTC, as these would facilitate the identification of additional prognostic factors and potential targets for novel therapies.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Building and expanding on principles of statistics, machine learning, and scientific inquiry, we propose the predictability, computability, and stability (PCS) framework for veridical data science. Our framework, composed of both a workflow and documentation, aims to provide responsible, reliable, reproducible, and transparent results across the data science life cycle. The PCS workflow uses predictability as a reality check and considers the importance of computation in data collection/storage and algorithm design. It augments predictability and computability with an overarching stability principle. Stability expands on statistical uncertainty considerations to assess how human judgment calls impact data results through data and model/algorithm perturbations. As part of the PCS workflow, we develop PCS inference procedures, namely PCS perturbation intervals and PCS hypothesis testing, to investigate the stability of data results relative to problem formulation, data cleaning, modeling decisions, and interpretations. We illustrate PCS inference through neuroscience and genomics projects of our own and others. Moreover, we demonstrate its favorable performance over existing methods in terms of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in high-dimensional, sparse linear model simulations, including a wide range of misspecified models. Finally, we propose PCS documentation based on R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook, with publicly available, reproducible codes and narratives to back up human choices made throughout an analysis. The PCS workflow and documentation are demonstrated in a genomics case study available on Zenodo.",Generic

"Thyroid cancers frequently have a good prognosis, most of the patients are young and have a long life expectancy. Several hundreds of cases have to be observed over two to five decades before establishing studies of significant actuarial survival and determining the initial prognostic factors likely to characterize the disease. These elements necessitate the creation of a thyroid cancer registry gathering together, from several centres, the data and allowing a computerized multifactorial analysis. Each hospital will have the possibility to participate, with the help of the Belgian Campaign against Cancer, by means of a simple computerized system. Pathologists, endocrinologists, radiologists, radioisotope specialists and surgeons will coordinate their efforts to supply the necessary data to epidemiologists, statisticians and fundamental-researchers.

"A personalized approach to the management of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) presents several challenges; however, in the past decade significant progress has been made in both diagnostic and treatment modalities. Germline rearranged in transfection (RET) testing in multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 and 3, and somatic RET testing in sporadic MTC have revolutionized the treatment options available to patients. Positron emission tomography imaging with novel radioligands has improved characterization of disease and a new international grading system can predict prognosis. Systemic therapy for persistent and metastatic disease has evolved significantly with targeted kinase therapy especially for those harboring germline or somatic RET variants. Selpercatinib and pralsetinib are highly selective RET kinase inhibitors that have shown improved progression-free survival with better tolerability than outcomes seen in earlier multikinase inhibitor studies. Here we discuss changes in paradigms for MTC patients: from determining RET alteration status upfront to novel techniques for the evaluation of this heterogenous disease. Successes and challenges with kinase inhibitor use will illustrate how managing this rare malignancy continues to evolve.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Of 195 cases of colon cancer operated on between January 1972 and April 1985, 56 (30.3%) were with macroscopic invasion into surrounding organs. Among them, 45 patients underwent combined resection of the colon and one or more adjacent organs, and in 60% of them, the tumor invasion was verified microscopically. The organ invaded most frequently was the abdominal wall (26 cases), followed by the bladder (7) and stomach (6). The operative mortality was 8.9%, and the five-year survival rate in the curative resection group was 70.9%. Even the noncurative resection group showed a significantly longer mean survival time than the nonresectable group. Combined resection should be undertaken unless the patient is seriously ill.",Colon_Cancer
"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. It is categorized into two histological groups that have distinct clinical behaviors, the nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and the small cell lung cancer (SCLC). When identified at an early stage, NSCLC is treated by surgical resection. However, patients who undergo surgical resection still have a relative low survival rate, primarily for tumor recurrence. Unfortunately, advances in cytotoxic therapy have reached a plateau and new approaches to treatment are needed together with new and better parameters for more accurate prediction of the outcome and more precise indication of the efficacy of the treatment. Several in vitro studies have examined the role of Clusterin (CLU) in carcinogenesis, lung cancer progression, and response to chemo- and radiotherapy. Studies performed in lung cancer cell lines and animal models showed that CLU is upregulated after exposure to chemo- and radiotherapy. A potential role proposed for the protein is cytoprotective. In vitro, CLU silencing by antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) and small-interfering RNAs (siRNA) directed against CLU mRNA in CLU-rich lung cancer cell lines sensitized cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and decreased their metastatic potential. In vivo, a recent work analyzed the prognostic role of CLU in NSCLC, showing that CLU-positive patients with lung cancer had a better overall survival and disease-free survival than those with CLU-negative tumors. These data are contradictory to the promising in vitro results. From the results of these studies we may hypothesize that in early-stage lung cancers CLU represents a positive biomarker correlating with better overall survival. In advanced patients, already treated with chemo- and radiotherapy, the induction of CLU may confer resistance to the treatments. However, many studies are needed to better understand the role of CLU in early-stage and advanced lung cancers with the aim to discriminate patients and specific local conditions that could benefit for a CLU knocking down treatment.",Lung_Cancer
"With the joint advancement in areas such as pervasive neural data sensing, neural computing, neuromodulation and artificial intelligence, neural interface has become a promising technology facilitating both the closed-loop neurorehabilitation for neurologically impaired patients and the intelligent man-machine interactions for general application purposes.

In this survey, we systematically investigated possible cybersecurity risks in neural interfaces, together with potential solutions to these problems. Importantly, our survey considers interfacing techniques on both central nervous systems (i.e., brain-computer interfaces) and peripheral nervous systems (i.e., general neural interfaces), covering diverse neural modalities such as electroencephalography, electromyography and more. Moreover, our survey is organized on three different levels: (1) the data level, which mainly focuses on the privacy leakage issue via attacking and analyzing neural database of users; (2) the permission level, which mainly focuses on the prospects and risks to directly use real time neural signals as biometrics for continuous and unobtrusive user identity verification; and (3) the model level, which mainly focuses on adversarial attacks and defenses on both the forward neural decoding models (e.g. via machine learning) and the backward feedback implementation models (e.g. via neuromodulation and stimulation).

"A 78-year-old man was referred to our hospital with diarrhea, melena, and weight loss. During a digital rectal examination, a protuberant mass located 7-8 cm above the anal verge was palpable. Computed tomography(CT)scans of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed an intestinal obstruction with a target sign in the lower rectum, indicating intussusception due to a sigmoid colon mass. A gastrografin enema examination revealed a typical filling defect with a crab claw sign in the rectum. However, the enema did not reduce the intussusception. The surgical findings showed that the sigmoid colon had slipped inside the rectum, consistent with the diagnostic imaging findings. A radical sigmoidectomy(D2)with diverting colostomy was performed to address the unprepared colon with accompanying edema. Pathology of the resected specimen revealed a type 2 tumor measuring 5 cm in size and comprising moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma(pT3pN0M0, pStage ). The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and his stoma was closed 2 months later. Intussusception occurs less frequently in adults than in children. In a case of bowel-within-bowel configuration, in which layers of the bowel are duplicated to form concentric rings, the target-like sign on CT images may be a useful diagnostic marker of colorectal intussusception.",Colon_Cancer
"From these data and data from the literature, our recommended treatment for well-differentiated cancer is as follows: For papillary cancer, resection should be adequate to encompass the entire tumor, which in most cases would be complete lobectomy and possibly isthmusectomy. Prophylactic neck dissection is of no value; therapeutic modified neck dissection should be done for stage II disease. Follicular cancer can be treated by lobectomy (for small lesions) or subtotal thyroidectomy. Although total or near-total thyroidectomy may be required in selected patients with large primary cancers or in those with extensive capsular invasion or extrathyroid extension, the number of cases indicating this is small. There were only a few such patients with large primaries requiring total thyroidectomy in this study. Total thyroidectomy is best avoided in most cases, considering the price of hypoparathyroidism and the lack of significant improvement in survival compared with lesser ablative techniques. Postoperative ablation with iodine-131 did not improve survival in staged patients with papillary cancer (the number of patients with follicular cancer was too small for analysis). Postoperative thyroid suppression by exogenous thyroid hormone postoperatively appeared to improve survival. Although the data were not adequate for evaluation in follicular cancer, there seems to be no reason not to use this postoperatively in high-risk patients with either papillary or follicular cancer.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system with a steadily rising incidence. The term ""thyroid cancer"" encompasses a spectrum of subtypes, namely papillary thyroid cancer, follicular thyroid cancer, anaplastic thyroid cancer, and medullary thyroid cancer. Each subtype differs histopathologically and in degrees of cellular differentiation, which may be in part due to signaling of the Notch pathway. The Notch pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction mechanism that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, stem cell maintenance, embryonic and adult development, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis. Its role in cancer biology is controversial, as it has been shown to play both an oncogenic and tumor-suppressive role in many different types of cancers. This discordance holds true for each subtype of thyroid cancer, indicating that Notch signaling is likely cell type and context dependent. Whether oncogenic or not, Notch signaling has proven to be significantly involved in the tumorigenesis of thyroid cancer and has thus earned interest as a therapeutic target. Advancement in the understanding of Notch signaling in thyroid cancer holds great promise for the development of novel treatment strategies to benefit patients.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Radiation is an environmental factor that elevates the risk of developing thyroid cancer. Actual and possible scenarios of exposures to external and internal radiation are multiple and diverse. This article reviews radiation doses to the thyroid and corresponding cancer risks due to planned, existing, and emergency exposure situations, and medical, public, and occupational categories of exposures. Any exposure scenario may deliver a range of doses to the thyroid, and the risk for cancer is addressed along with modifying factors. The consequences of the Chornobyl and Fukushima nuclear power plant accidents are described, summarizing the information on thyroid cancer epidemiology, treatment, and prognosis, clinicopathological characteristics, and genetic alterations. The Chornobyl thyroid cancers have evolved in time: becoming less aggressive and driver shifting from fusions to point mutations. A comparison of thyroid cancers from the 2 areas reveals numerous differences that cumulatively suggest the low probability of the radiogenic nature of thyroid cancers in Fukushima. In view of continuing usage of different sources of radiation in various settings, the possible ways of reducing thyroid cancer risk from exposures are considered. For external exposures, reasonable measures are generally in line with the As Low As Reasonably Achievable principle, while for internal irradiation from radioactive iodine, thyroid blocking with stable iodine may be recommended in addition to other measures in case of anticipated exposures from a nuclear reactor accident. Finally, the perspectives of studies of radiation effects on the thyroid are discussed from the epidemiological, basic science, and clinical points of view.",Thyroid_Cancer

Coffee intake, which was inversely associated with cancer risk, exerted a modification effect, with an odds ratio of 1.89 for frequent eaters who drank fewer than two cups of coffee per day. Frequent eating increases, whereas high coffee intake decreases, the excretion of bile acids, which are suspected to be carcinogenic to the colon. Thus, it is conceivable that frequent coffee intake may counterbalance the effect of frequent eating.",Colon_Cancer

"Lung cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. Its overall survival rate has improved only slightly, and surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy remain the mainstays of current treatment. Therapies with novel targeted agents are currently under active investigation in all settings of treatment including chemoprevention, defined as the use of natural or synthetic agents to interrupt the process of carcinogenesis and to prevent or delay tumor occurrence. Thus, chemoprevention describes the collaborative efforts of researchers in basic science and clinical settings who study the biology of lung cancer with the hope of uncovering new mechanisms of treatment. Because lung cancer has become an increasingly difficult problem to treat with standard therapies, chemopreventive strategies have been developed. Small molecule compounds that target specific receptors or mutations will play an increasingly significant role in treatment of lung cancer because the side effect profiles of such agents are tolerable and they may be more effective than other treatments.",Lung_Cancer
"We present a retrospective case series of patients with hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer. Our goal was to look at their clinical characteristics and outcomes to determine which patients would require further investigation. We reviewed the case notes of all patients with a histopathologic diagnosis of thyroid cancer and biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism who had been treated at a thyroid cancer center from January 2006 through October 2013. During that time, 66 patients had been diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Of these, 8 patients (12%)-all women, aged 29 to 87 years (mean: 55.6; median: 50.5)-had biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism. Among these 8 patients, 4 had an autonomously functioning toxic nodule (AFTN), 3 were diagnosed with Graves disease, and 1 had a toxic multinodular goiter. Five patients had suspicious features on preoperative ultrasonography. All 8 patients were diagnosed with the papillary type of thyroid carcinoma. The mean size of the tumor in the 4 patients with AFTN was significantly larger than it was in those with Graves disease (42.3 23.8 mm vs. 3.8 1.6; p = 0.04). The 3 patients with Graves disease all had incidentally found papillary microcarcinoma. Between these two groups, the patients with AFTN had a poorer prognosis; 2 of them had extracapsular invasion and lymph node metastasis, and another died of her disease. We found that the incidence of hyperthyroidism in thyroid cancer patients was relatively high (12%). In contrast to what has previously been reported in the literature, patients with AFTN seem to have more aggressive disease and poorer outcomes than do patients with Graves disease.

Twenty-two patients had subsequent reexploration (23 disk spaces). The unenhanced and enhanced studies of these patients were interpreted independently without surgical information. With contrast enhancement, only three CT studies were considered indeterminate, whereas 10 studies without contrast enhancement were indeterminate. The overall correct diagnosis with contrast enhancement was 17 (74%) of 23, while only 43% of the unenhanced studies yielded the correct diagnosis. Therefore, intravenous contrast enhancement significantly increased the diagnostic accuracy and level of confidence in making the differentiation between recurrent herniated disk and scar.",Thyroid_Cancer
"During the last decade, a substantial amount of progress has been made in the understanding of the relationship between the dietary constituents and the development of colon cancer in man. The information base is sufficiently convincing with respect to an enhancing effect as a function of total fat intake and a protective effect of certain dietary fibers in colon cancer. The populations with high incidence of colon cancer are characterized by consumption of high-dietary fat which may be a risk factor in the absence of factors that are protective, such as use of whole-grain cereals, high fibrous foods and vegetables mainly of cruciferous type. Application of the findings made thus far in colon cancer research for the general public is, therefore, to have a far-reaching impact on the major premature, killing diseases in the western world.",Colon_Cancer
"Lung cancer radiation therapy (RT) is associated with complex geometrical uncertainties, such as respiratory motion, differential baseline shifts between primary tumor and involved lymph nodes, and anatomical changes due to treatment response. Generous safety margins required to account for these uncertainties limit the potential of dose escalation to improve treatment outcome. Four dimensional inverse planning incorporating pretreatment patient-specific respiratory motion information into the treatment plan already improves treatment plan quality. More importantly, repetitive imaging during treatment quantifies patient-specific intrafraction, interfraction, and progressive geometrical variations. These patient-specific parameters subsequently can drive adaptive plan modification correcting for systematic errors while incorporating random errors. Adaptive RT therefore has the potential to considerably improve the accuracy of RT, reducing the exposure of organs at risk, facilitating safe dose escalation, and improving local control as well as overall survival.",Lung_Cancer
Whether thyroid re-operations are associated with an increased complication risk is controversial.

"Follicular, papillary, anaplastic and medullary cancers of the thyroid were investigated using immunohistochemical methods. The following antibodies were used: anti-S-100, antineuron-specific enolase (NSE), antikeratin, antithyroglobulin, anticalcitonin, anticarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), antiepithelial membrane antigen (EMA); the following hormones were also tested in the medullary carcinoma: gastrin, ACTH and serotonin. Papillary and follicular carcinoma in particular reacted with anti-S-100 and anti-NSE; the anaplastic neoplasia reacted with anti-S-100 (25%), anti-NSE (12%), antikeratin (12%), antithyroglobulin (12%), anti-CEA (37%) and anti-EMA (37%). Medullary carcinoma reacted with anticalcitonin (100%), anti-CEA (96%), anti-NSE (79%), anti-EMA (4%) and anti-S-100 (17%). We were not able to correlate the virulence of the medullary carcinoma with the anticalcitonin and anti-CEA reactivity, while the hyperplastic C cells were immunoreactive both with calcitonin or with CEA.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Some factors related to Westernization or industrialization increase risk of colon cancer. It is believed widely that this increase in risk is related to the direct effects of dietary fat and fiber in the colonic lumen. However, the fat and fiber hypotheses, at least as originally formulated, do not explain adequately many emerging findings from recent epidemiologic studies. An alternative hypothesis, that hyperinsulinemia promotes colon carcinogenesis, is presented here. Insulin is an important growth factor of colonic epithelial cells and is a mitogen of tumor cell growth in vitro. Epidemiologic evidence supporting the insulin/colon-cancer hypothesis is largely indirect and based on the similarity of factors which produce elevated insulin levels with those related to colon cancer risk. Specifically, obesity--particularly central obesity, physical inactivity, and possibly a low dietary polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat ratio--are major determinants of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, and appear related to colon cancer risk. Moreover, a diet high in refined carbohydrates and low in water-soluble fiber, which is associated with an increased risk of colon cancer, causes rapid intestinal absorption of glucose into the blood leading to postprandial hyperinsulinemia. The combination of insulin resistance and high glycemic load produces particularly high insulin levels. Thus, hyperinsulinemia may explain why obesity, physical inactivity, and a diet low in fruits and vegetables and high in red meat and extensively processed foods, all common in the West, increase colon cancer risk.",Colon_Cancer
"Deep learning is a form of machine learning using a convolutional neural network architecture that shows tremendous promise for imaging applications. It is increasingly being adapted from its original demonstration in computer vision applications to medical imaging. Because of the high volume and wealth of multimodal imaging information acquired in typical studies, neuroradiology is poised to be an early adopter of deep learning. Compelling deep learning research applications have been demonstrated, and their use is likely to grow rapidly. This review article describes the reasons, outlines the basic methods used to train and test deep learning models, and presents a brief overview of current and potential clinical applications with an emphasis on how they are likely to change future neuroradiology practice. Facility with these methods among neuroimaging researchers and clinicians will be important to channel and harness the vast potential of this new method.",Generic
"Thyroid cancer is a rare and complex disease. The thyroid contains various cell types from which distinct diseases arise. These malignancies range from indolent to extremely aggressive. Diagnosis includes attention to risk factors, family history, and subjective reports. The most valuable tool for diagnosis is the fine-needle aspiration. Primary treatment is surgery with postoperative hormone therapy. Radiation and chemotherapy serve palliative and adjuvant roles in advanced, recurrent, or metastatic disease. Nurses make a significant contribution to patient understanding and successful treatment outcome.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Cancer omics data are exponentially created and associated with clinical variables, and important findings can be extracted based on bioinformatics approaches which can then be experimentally validated. Many of these findings are related to a specific class of non-coding RNA molecules called microRNAs (miRNAs) (post-transcriptional regulators of mRNA expression). The related research field is quite heterogeneous and bioinformaticians, clinicians, statisticians and biologists, as well as data miners and engineers collaborate to cure stored data and on new impulses coming from the output of the latest Next Generation Sequencing technologies. Here we review the main research findings on miRNA of the first 10 years in colon cancer research with an emphasis on possible uses in clinical practice. This review intends to provide a road map in the jungle of publications of miRNA in colorectal cancer, focusing on data availability and new ways to generate biologically relevant information out of these huge amounts of data.",Colon_Cancer
"The large use of simple and effective diagnostic tools has significantly contributed to the increase in diagnosis of thyroid cancer over the past years. However, there is compelling evidence that most micropapillary carcinomas have an indolent behavior and may never evolve into clinical cancers. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new tools able to predict which thyroid cancers will remain silent, and which thyroid cancers will present an aggressive behavior. There are a number of well-established clinical predictors of malignancy and recent studies have suggested that some of the patients laboratory data and image methods may be useful. Molecular markers have also been increasingly tested and some of them appear to be very promising, such as BRAF, a few GST genes and p53 polymorphisms. In addition, modern tools, such as immunocytochemical markers, and the measure of the fractal nature of chromatin organization may increase the specificity of the pathological diagnosis of malignancy and help ascertain the prognosis. Guidelines designed to select nodules for further evaluation, as well as new methods aimed at distinguishing carcinomas of higher aggressiveness among the usually indolent thyroid tumors are an utmost necessity.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The use of molecular assays to analyze clinical tissues in the diagnosis and management of thyroid cancer, similar to other tumors, will likely allow for more accurate characterization of the aggressiveness of individual tumors and may allow for the early diagnosis of recurrence. The application of these methods to thyroid nodules and nodal metastases is less encumbered by difficulties arising from amplification of transcripts in non-thyroid cells. For these tissues, these assays are likely to be used clinically in the near-future. New data arising from cDNA arrays identifying novel markers of malignancy or tumor aggressiveness make this a growing area of interest. The use of molecular assays in diagnosing distant metastases is more problematic due to issues with ectopic expression of either full length or splice variants of genes thought to be thyroid-specific. Assay quantitation is a complex problem owing to variability in the level of expression of ""housekeeping"" genes and the variety of phlebotomy and RT-PCR methods reported. Additional research in this area is clearly required before a recommendation can be given regarding clinically applicability of these tests.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Apoptosis is a genetically programmed process of controlled and orderly cell suicide, which is critical for multicellular organisms during development and tissue homeostasis. In cancer, the ratio of apoptosis to cell division is altered, resulting in a net gain of malignant tissue. Tumor cells may acquire resistance to apoptosis by the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, or by the down-regulation or mutation of pro-apoptotic mediators. In the classic pathway of apoptosis, this process is primarily coordinated by activation of caspases. Decreased expression of caspases inversely correlates with the aggressiveness of cancer. Increased activity of caspases renders cancer cells susceptible to chemoradiotherapeutic modalities. Thus, caspase activity is pivotal in carcinogenesis. The functions of activated caspases are inhibited by the binding of inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs). The function of IAPs is regulated by pro-apoptotic protein Second Mitochondria-Derived Activator of Caspases (Smac) or Direct IAP Binding Protein with low isoelectric point, pI (DIABLO). Induction of apoptosis leads to increased mitochondrial permeability to Smac/DIABLO, which adheres to IAPs inhibiting their caspase-binding activity. The role of Smac/DIABLO, therefore, may have significant diagnostic and therapeutic features in carcinogenesis. The role of Smac/DIABLO in colorectal carcinogenesis is ill defined. Data continues to accumulate to suggest that decreased levels of Smac/DIABLO may be important in chemoradiation-resistance to apoptosis in advanced colon cancer. The aim of this review is to provide the available evidence of the role of Smac/DIABLO in colon carcinogenesis.",Colon_Cancer
"In the era of the personalized medicine, we need not only to an accurate diagnosis of lung cancer but also to assess the molecular pathways involved in order to target them. The most relevant targets in lung cancer are the genes EGFR, ALK-EML4, ROS1, Her2Neu, BRAF. Mutations or translocations of these genes are performed on biopsies in 80% of the cases and 30% of the patients cannot have their molecular tests done. This may be due to the lack of tumor samples secondary to the morphologic and immunohistochemical techniques, contraindication to biopsy or difficulties to biopsy. Besides, tumor cells tend to activate other pathways that weren't activated at the onset in order to escape to therapeutic drugs. This phenomenon of resistance is observed 3 to 6 months after the onset of the treatment. In order to escape all these limitations, liquid biopsy was developed. It consists in a simple blood sample of 5 to 10 ml in which circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, tumor RNA, exosomes and secretomes are explored. In this paper, we tried to define liquid biopsy, to highlight the means of diagnosis, its limits, its advantages and its perspectives in Tunisia.",Lung_Cancer

"In a prospective study a total of 155 patients were investigated, 72 of whom had carcinoma of the colon confirmed by colonoscopy and biopsy, while 83 had no bowel disease. Among the patients with carcinoma of the colon, pathological changes of the bowel wall were reliably detected by ultrasound in 81.9% of the cases. Among the patients without bowel disease, 91.6% of the cases were interpreted as being unremarkable. In 7.1% of all cases the finding was classified as uncertain. In the cases of carcinoma detected by ultrasound, the localization of the lesion was correctly determined in 91.5%. The ultrasonographic appearance of the carcinoma of the colon depends on the stage of progression. In an early stage it reveals a circumscribed non-circular thickening of the bowel wall. The typical feature of a late stage is a hypoechoic tumour with a narrow ribbon of echoes. This ribbon of echoes is either located in the center of the tumour or more frequently eccentric. It is a hint on the intestinal origin of the tumour and represents a stenosis of the lumen. Ultrasonography is useful as a supplementary method in the investigation of the large bowel. However a carcinoma of the colon cannot be excluded on the basis of the ultrasonographic image.",Colon_Cancer

"Enigma protein, encoded by the PDLIM7 gene, is overexpressed in thyroid cancer in a stage-dependent manner, suggesting a potential involvement in the initiation and progression of thyroid cancer. The Enigma interacts with several cellular pathways, including PI3K/AKT, MDM2, and BMP-1. The Enigma is regulated by microRNAs. Specifically, we showed that the Enigma protein upregulation corresponds to the downregulation of Let-7 family genes. There is limited research on the interactions and regulation of the Enigma with other proteins/genes in thyroid cancer tissues, indicating a gap in current knowledge. Our aim is to establish the Enigma as a biomarker. We also aim to study the interacting partners of the Enigma signaling pathways and their probable miRNA regulation in thyroid cancer progression. Using Western blotting, densitometric analysis, immunoprecipitation (IP), and reverse IP, we detected the protein expression and protein-protein interactions in the corresponding papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). Utilizing real-time qPCR assay and Pearson's correlation test, we highlighted the correlation between PDLIM7 and Let-7g gene expression in the same tissues. The results showed the differential upregulations of the Enigma protein in different stages of PTCs compared to benign tissues along with AKT, VDR, BMP-1, and MDM2 proteins. Loss of DBP was observed in a subset of PTCs. Strong interactions of the Enigma with PI3K/AKT and MDM2 were noted, along with a weaker BMP-1 interaction. Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis between PDLIM7 and let-7g gene expression was significant (p < 0.05); however, there was a weak inverse correlation (r = -0.27). The study suggests the potential utility of the PDLIM7-qPCR assay as a biomarker for thyroid cancer. The Enigma's interactions with key signaling pathways may provide valuable insights into the development of thyroid cancer. The study contributes to understanding the molecular mechanisms involving the Enigma protein in thyroid cancer and highlights its potential as a biomarker.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Mucinous adenocarcinoma (MA) of colorectal cancer seems associated with reduced responsiveness to chemotherapy. The overexpression of markers of resistance to fluorouracil and oxaliplatin has recently been demonstrated. We revised the outcomes of metastatic MA of the colon treated with FOLFOX. From January 2002 to December 2009, we treated 198 patients with metastatic colon cancer, of which 21 (10.6%) had diagnosis of MA and were compared with 42 control patients with non-mucinous adenocarcinoma (NMA). In MA group, three patients [14%; inhibitory concentration 95: 7.5%] reached partial response, and in NMA group, two patients obtained complete response and 16 obtained partial response with an overall response rate of 43% (inhibitory concentration 95: 7.6%) with a significant statistical difference (P = 0.027).

"RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become an exemplary technology in modern biology and clinical science. Its immense popularity is due in large part to the continuous efforts of the bioinformatics community to develop accurate and scalable computational tools to analyze the enormous amounts of transcriptomic data that it produces. RNA-seq analysis enables genes and their corresponding transcripts to be probed for a variety of purposes, such as detecting novel exons or whole transcripts, assessing expression of genes and alternative transcripts, and studying alternative splicing structure. It can be a challenge, however, to obtain meaningful biological signals from raw RNA-seq data because of the enormous scale of the data as well as the inherent limitations of different sequencing technologies, such as amplification bias or biases of library preparation. The need to overcome these technical challenges has pushed the rapid development of novel computational tools, which have evolved and diversified in accordance with technological advancements, leading to the current myriad of RNA-seq tools.

"From histological and biological perspectives, lung cancer is a complex neoplasm. Although the sequential preneoplastic changes have been defined for centrally arising squamous carcinomas of the lung, they have been poorly documented for the other major forms of lung cancers, including small cell lung carcinoma and adenocarcinomas. There are three main morphologic forms of preneoplastic lesions recognized in the lung: squamous dysplasias, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, and diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia. However, these lesions account for the development of only a subset of lung cancers. Several studies have provided information regarding the molecular characterization of lung preneoplastic changes, especially for squamous cell carcinoma. These molecular changes have been detected in the histologically normal and abnormal respiratory epithelium of smokers. Two different molecular pathways have been detected in lung adenocarcinoma pathogenesis: smoking-associated activation of RAS signaling, and nonsmoking-associated activation of EGFR signaling; the latter is detected in histologically normal respiratory epithelium.",Lung_Cancer

"Well-differentiated thyroid cancer most frequently occurs in premenopausal women. Greater exposure to estrogens may be a risk factor for thyroid cancer. To investigate the role of estrogens in thyroid cancer, a spot urine sample was obtained from 40 women with thyroid cancer and 40 age-matched controls. Thirty-eight estrogen metabolites, conjugates and DNA adducts were analyzed by using ultraperformance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and the ratio of adducts to metabolites and conjugates was calculated for each sample. The ratio of depurinating estrogen-DNA adducts to estrogen metabolites and conjugates significantly differed between cases and controls (p < 0.0001), demonstrating high specificity and sensitivity. These findings indicate that estrogen metabolism is unbalanced in thyroid cancer and suggest that formation of estrogen-DNA adducts might play a role in the initiation of thyroid cancer.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Proliferative thyroid diseases are more prevalent in females than in males. Upon the onset of puberty, the incidence of thyroid cancer increases in females only and declines again after menopause. Estrogen is a potent growth factor both for benign and malignant thyroid cells that may explain the sex difference in the prevalence of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer. It exerts its growth-promoting effect through a classical genomic and a non-genomic pathway, mediated via a membrane-bound estrogen receptor. This receptor is linked to the tyrosine kinase signaling pathways MAPK and PI3K. In papillary thyroid carcinomas, these pathways may be activated either by a chromosomal rearrangement of the tyrosine receptor kinase TRKA, by RET/PTC genes, or by a BRAF mutation and, in addition, in females they may be stimulated by high levels of estrogen. Furthermore, estrogen is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and metastasis that are critical for the outcome of thyroid cancer.

The primary surgical strategy should avoid the need for reoperation. The extent of reoperation is related to the extent of primary surgery, stage, and distant metastasis.

The objectives of this review are to cite and appraise the available evidence on the role of parvoviruses in thyroid cancer in particular. Little to no evidence is available directly linking animal parvoviruses and thyroid cancer, but there is a growing literature on the human erythrovirus B19 (EVB19) and its association with thyroid cancer. Of particular interest is the persistence and expression of EVB19 DNA, RNA, and protein in a wide variety of thyroid tissues.

"The surgical standards in the treatment of primary cancer of the colon include the radical resection of the tumor-bearing colon with truncal ligation of its vessels. Eradication of the tumor with complete dissection of the lymphatic drainage area increases the chance for cure (R0). The lymphatic dissection determines the extent of colonic resection: right hemicolectomy (ileo-transversostomy) with truncal ligation of the iliocolic and right colonic arteries for carcinomas of the cecum and ascending colon; transverse colectomy (ascendo-descendostomy) with ligation of the middle colic artery for carcinomas in the middle of the transverse colon; left hemicolectomy (transverso-rectostomy) with ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery at the aorta for cancer of the descending and sigmoid colon; extended sigmoid resection (descendo-rectostomy) with central lymphadenectomy and ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery distal to the left colic artery for cancer of the distal sigmoid colon. Carcinomas located in between two drainage areas (lateral transverse colon, hepatic or splenic flexure) are treated by extended hemicolectomies or subtotal colectomies with dissection of two lymphatic drainage areas. The monobloc no-touch isolation technique requires the ligation of vessels prior to the mobilisation of the colon.

"The prevalence of nodular lesions of the thyroid gland (thyroid gland), according to various researchers, ranges from 3 to 7%]. The widespread introduction of ultrasound (ultrasound) in clinical practice, as well as the results of autopsy studies, showed that the prevalence of nodular lesions of the thyroid gland is much higher and is about 50%, especially at the age of over 50. In women, thyroid nodes are detected 2-4 times more often than in men. Children suffer from nodular lesions extremely rarely. The incidence of nodular goiter is directly proportional to age. The increase in the incidence of nodular goiter is approximately 0.1% per year at a young age and gradually reaches 2%. The prevalence of thyroid cancer (thyroid cancer) among nodular goiter, according to various authors, is from 1 to 6%. It should be noted that the prevalence in the population of nodular goiter is so high both in the regions of iodine deficiency and with normal iodine supply, but in the first case it is slightly higher. The incidence of thyroid cancer in absolute terms does not depend on the level of iodine supply. Thus, in a situation of a slightly higher incidence of banal nodular colloid goiter in the regions of iodine deficiency, the proportion of cancer among all cases of nodular goiter will be less. It is important to note that these data make it possible to equally use the results of studies on thyroid cancer obtained in regions with different iodine supply.",Thyroid_Cancer

For patients who cannot tolerate oxaliplatin, 5-FU can be given as a single agent. Patients with metastatic disease may be treated with a number of regimens, including FOLFOX and FOLFIRI; however, the environment is a not a monotonous vanilla and chocolate FOLFOX and FOLFIRI. Cytotoxic agents, sequentially or in combination, are frequently combined with biologic agents to improve response in metastatic disease. Clinical investigators have focused considerable attention on how best to apply all the agents active in metastatic colon cancer, a practice in evolution. In this article, we highlight important, informative research regarding cytotoxic chemotherapy for colon cancer. We also recognize the contribution made by skilled surgeons, interventional radiologists, and radiation oncologists who will push the envelope and as well, the pharmacogenomic and molecular markers that help us to understand mechanisms of disease, predict toxicity, and refine our therapy.",Colon_Cancer
"Since 1975, the American Cancer Society, Illinois Division, has published end results of major cancer sites drawn from patient data contributed voluntarily by hospital cancer registries throughout the state. The current study was undertaken, in part, to apprehend information regarding contested areas in the management of patients having differentiated (papillary/follicular) thyroid cancer. A total of 2,282 patients with either papillary or follicular carcinoma of the thyroid from 76 different Illinois hospitals and providing 10 years of follow-up information (life-table analysis) were retrospectively analyzed for demographic, disease, and treatment-related predictors of survival. Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards method was made for stage, age, race, sex, morphology, history of radiation exposure, presence of positive lymph nodes, initial surgical treatment, postoperative iodine 131 therapy, and replacement/suppressive thyroid hormone treatment. Statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) predictors of favorable survival after thyroid cancer were low stage (I and II), young age (less than 50 years), white race, female sex, and the administration, postoperatively, of either thyroid hormone or radioactive iodine. Factors that had no influence on survival were lymph node status, choice of initial surgical treatment, and a history of prior irradiation. We suggest that where a prospective clinical trial is impracticable, a retrospective analysis of a large and detailed database, such as that available from cooperating hospital-based tumor registries, may yet provide useful insights to solutions of cancer management problems.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Colon cancer is one of the most common malignancies causing the majority of cancer-related deaths. Gelsolin (GSN) has been found to be dysregulated in various cancers. However, the secreted GSN in colon cancer remains largely unknown. In the present study, we explored the expression profile of GSN in colon cancer tissues and the diagnostic value of serum GSN in colon cancer. In addition, the effects of secreted GSN in colon cancer cells were studied. We thus found that immunoreactive GSN levels were significantly lower in colon cancer tissues than those in non-tumor colon tissues. Functional studies demonstrated that secreted GSN could restrain cell invasion and migration in vitro. Mechanistically, dose dependent recombinant GSN down-regulated the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, which might restrain the process of cell invasion and migration. Furthermore, serum levels of GSN were significantly lower in colon cancer patients than those in healthy volunteers, and ROC curves showed serum level of GSN had a better diagnostic value for colon cancer (AUC=0.932) than the traditional tumor biomarker Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) or Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 (CA199). In conclusion, our results suggest that the secreted GSN restrains the invasion and migration of colon cancer cells. Meanwhile, the serum GSN may be a new biomarker for the diagnosis of colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"There are many known chemical and physical causes of industrial lung cancer. Their common feature is a long latent period-usually ten to 40 years-between initial exposure to the carcinogen and clinical recognition of the lesion. Occupationally induced lung cancer is indistinguishable from lung cancer of unknown etiology or that caused by cigaret smoking. Smoking alone is responsible for a very large proportion of all lung cancer and it potentiates the effect of most other carcinogens. Most cases of lung cancer in the next 20-30 years will be the result of exposures which have already occurred. In these cases, early diagnosis of pre-invasive resectable lesions offers the only hope for prolonging life.",Lung_Cancer
"Many studies have provided observational data on the association of obesity and thyroid cancers, but only few of them propose mechanisms that would permit a better understanding of the causal molecular mechanisms of this association. Considering that there is an increasing incidence of both obesity and thyroid cancers, we need to summarize and link recent studies in order to characterize and understand the contribution of obesity-related factors that might affect thyroid cancer development and progression. Adipose tissue is involved in many vital processes, including insulin sensitivity, angiogenesis, regulation of energy balance, activation of the complement system, and responses such as inflammation. Although these processes have their own molecular pathways, they involve the same molecules through which obesity and adipose tissue might exert their roles in carcinogenesis, not only affecting MAPK and PI3K or even insulin pathways, but also recruiting local inflammatory responses that could result in disease formation and progression. This review describes five important issues that might explain the link between excessive weight and thyroid cancer: thyroid hormones, insulin resistance, adipokines, inflammation, and sexual hormones.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Objectives. Invasion of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) into surrounding structures can lead to morbid procedures such as laryngectomy and tracheal resection. In these patients, there is a potential role for neoadjuvant therapy. Methods. We identified three studies involving the treatment of DTC with neoadjuvant chemotherapy: two from Slovenia and one from Japan. Results. These studies demonstrate that in selected situations, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can have a good response and allow for a more complete surgical resection, the treatment of DTC. Additionally, the SELECT trial shows that the targeted therapy lenvatinib is effective in the treatment of DTC and could be useful as neoadjuvant therapy for this disease due to its short time to response. Pazopanib has also demonstrated promise in phase II data. Conclusions. Thus, chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting could possibly be useful for managing advanced DTC. Additionally, some of the new tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) hold promise for use in the neoadjuvant setting in DTC.",Thyroid_Cancer
"We report the case of a 45-year old woman with a 15-day history of anterior cervical swelling increasing very quickly in size associated with a 7-day history of local inflammation. Clinical examination showed voluminous tender and fixed swelling occupying all the anterior cervical region. The skin's surface was inflammed with permeation nodule (Figure 1, A). The patient was febrile at 38 with good overall physical condition Cervical ultrasound showed voluminous right laterocervical mass that, given the size, made surgical exploration difficult. CT scan showed voluminous thyroid mass, multi-cystic in the superficial tissues, compressing the trachea and the esophagus and pressing the vascular axis of the neck (Figure 1, B and C). Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis 13500 cells/ml, anemia to 8.3 g/dl, CRP 42mg/L and normal thyroid test. Fine needle aspiration biopsy showed purulent and very inflammed material without cytologic signs of malignancy. The patient underwent surgery. Surgical exploration showed several superficial cystic and haemorrhagic cubicles with, in depth, tumor tissue infiltrating the trachea. The tumor laterally invaded the right vascular axis and spread to the suprahyoid muscles, the right submandibular region and the twelfth cranial nerve. Total extended thyroidectomy was performed. Histological examination showed papillary thyroid carcinoma measuring 11cm along its longer axis. Based on our literature review, this is the first case of locally invasive papillary cystic carcinoma of the thyroid revealed by subacute infection.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid is rare, making up 5% to 14% of primary malignant thyroid neoplasms. Lymphoma of the thyroid is even rarer, accounting for only 1% to 2% of thyroid malignancies. Other even rarer tumors of the thyroid, such as liposarcoma and angiosarcoma, have also been described. Although these thyroid tumors are rare, it is very important to recognize them because they may present as medical emergencies and constitute a challenge for endocrinologists, surgeons, radiotherapists, and oncologists. Anaplastic carcinoma grows rapidly and has a dismal prognosis. A significant number of patients with anaplastic carcinoma have areas of well differentiated thyroid carcinoma, which supports the hypothesis that anaplastic thyroid carcinoma arises from a pre-existing well differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Younger patients do better than older patients, and those diagnosed at an earlier stage do better than those with metastases at presentation. Multimodality therapy with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy appears to be of value. Lymphoma of the thyroid may be a primary disease or may involve the gland as part of a systemic disease. It is not usually suspected before surgery or fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Radiotherapy alone, if the disease is limited to the neck, produces good results; however, in patients with mediastinal extension, chemotherapy is indicated.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Although resection is the mainstay of treatment of thyroid cancer, and radioactive iodine (131-1) is curative in a small number of patients with differentiated cancers, external irradiation is much more effective than is generally believed. This has been clearly shown in a review of 138 patients with thyroid cancer referred to a cancer centre, in most cases after an initial operation. External irradiation should be considered in all patients except those with pure papillary tumours that have been completely excised. It should be used (a) in conjunction with surgery if there is even a remote doubt as to the completeness of excision; (b) in conjunction with 131-1 in treating inoperable primary tumours or metastatic lesions; () alone for differentiated tumours (primary or metastatic) that do not take up 131-1; and, (d) perhaps combined with chemotherapy, for medullary and anaplastic tumours.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Sixty-six lung carcinomas have been examined by light and electron microscopy, as well as by immunocytochemical techniques using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. There was considerable heterogeneity with regard to cell type and in only 18 cases was it possible to classify the tumour as a solely small cell, squamous or adenocarcinoma. In the remaining cases there was evidence of two or three cell types. These findings support the thesis that all lung cancers are derived from a pluripotential basal or reserve cell in the bronchial mucosa which may proliferate along one or more lines of differentiation. This view of the histogenesis of lung cancer would account for the heterogeneous appearance of many tumours and the difficulty experienced in placing them in one of the standard classifications.",Lung_Cancer

"Colorectal cancer is becoming increasingly common in Asian countries and still remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Efforts to prevent colon cancer have targeted early detection through screening and chemoprevention. For the last ten years our laboratory has utilized an in vivo screening assay for the testing of potential cancer preventives for colon cancer. We have conducted investigations on over 150 compounds including many with botanical or herbal origins. As part of our program on natural products we have examined a number of herbal and botanical products in the aberrant crypt foci (ACF) assay including Korean red ginseng powder, green tea catechins, curcumin from the Indian culinary spice, tumeric, compounds from garlic and onion, resveratrol from red grapes, among others. In the ginseng experiments groups of 10 F344 rats were fed ginseng powder at a dose of 0.5 g/kg or 2 mg/kg for 5 weeks. During weeks 2 and 3 rats were injected with 10 mg/kg azoxymethane to induce ACF. Controls (n=10) did not receive azoxymethane (AOM). Rats were killed by CO2 overdose and ACF counted in the rat colon. In 8 week post-initiation experiments ginseng powder inhibited the progression of established ACF, indicating a cytostatic effect. This may be due to an anti-inflammatory effect. There is a body of literature that suggests that compounds in wine, tumeric, and tea inhibit cyclooxygenases, thus reducing prostaglandin-mediated effects on the colon. As colon tumors have been shown to highly express COX-2 protein, and given, that many NSAID drugs also suppress COX-1, it is tempting to speculate that herbal products that inhibit one or both forms of the COX enzyme will be effective agents for the prevention of cancer in man.",Colon_Cancer
"Notch signalling has been reported to be involved in initiation, progression, and suppression in various types of cancer. The pathological significance of Notch1 has been well studied in lung cancer, but that of Notch2 remains unclear. An immunohistochemical study was performed to clarify the expression of NOTCH2 in non-neoplastic lung tissues and lung cancers in comparison with Clara (Club) cell 10 kDa protein (CC10), and western blotting analysis was performed to detect NOTCH2 in human cancer cell lines. A Notch2 gene knockdown experiment was carried out to reveal the function of Notch2. Transient transfection of the intracellular domain of the Notch2 (N2ICD) gene was used. In addition, the relationship of the expressions of Notch1, 2, and 3 was studied. Immunohistochemical study of lung tissues revealed that NOTCH2 was detected in bronchiolar epithelial cells and was often colocalised with CC10, and that adenocarcinoma tissues were more positively stained than those of squamous cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma. In human lung cancer cell lines, expression of NOTCH2 was similar to that of NOTCH1, and preferentially detected in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines. Knockdown of the Notch2 gene in NSCLC cell lines showed no remarkable changes in expression of molecules associated with cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and motility, and the seemingly unvalued effects of Notch2 gene knockdown could be masked by concomitant Notch1 activation, as indicated by an increase in the intracellular domain of NOTCH1. Additionally, transient transfection of the N2ICD gene induced CC10 expression in an adenocarcinoma cell line. The present study revealed that Notch2 is important in Club cell differentiation in normal lungs and adenocarcinoma. Notch2 is regulated mutually with Notch1, and the balance of the expression of Notch receptors could determine the biological behaviours of lung cancer cells.",Lung_Cancer

"Thyroid cancers are the most common of the endocrine system malignancies and progress must be made in the areas of differential diagnosis and treatment to improve patient management. Advances in the understanding of carcinogenic mechanisms have occurred in various fronts, including studies of the chaperone system (CS). Components of the CS are found to be quantitatively increased or decreased, and some correlations have been established between the quantitative changes and tumor type, prognosis, and response to treatment. These correlations provide the basis for identifying distinctive patterns useful in differential diagnosis and for planning experiments aiming at elucidating the role of the CS in tumorigenesis. Here, we discuss studies of the CS components in various thyroid cancers (TC). The chaperones belonging to the families of the small heat-shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp90 and the chaperonin of Group I, Hsp60, have been quantified mostly by immunohistochemistry and Western blot in tumor and normal control tissues and in extracellular vesicles. Distinctive differences were revealed between the various thyroid tumor types. The most frequent finding was an increase in the chaperones, which can be attributed to the augmented need for chaperones the tumor cells have because of their accelerated metabolism, growth, and division rate. Thus, chaperones help the tumor cell rather than protect the patient, exemplifying chaperonopathies by mistake or collaborationism. This highlights the need for research on chaperonotherapy, namely the development of means to eliminate/inhibit pathogenic chaperones.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the United States. Although both genetic and environmental factors play a role in colorectal tumorigenesis, recent advances in genetics have more clearly defined the impact of inheritance in the multistep process of the disease. Researchers have identified single genes that confer a susceptibility to familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Because these genes are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, offspring of carriers have a 50% chance of inheriting the gene mutation and its associated risk. The FAP gene, when mutated, initiates the neoplastic process. HNPCC gene mutations disrupt mismatch repair, thus inducing progression of tumor formation. Discovery of these genes has helped our understanding of sporadic colon cancer as well. Genetic testing for the FAP and HNPCC genes is now available, and results of this testing have implications for surveillance and management. In addition, testing raises complex psychosocial and ethical issues. At present, genetic testing is primarily conducted in the research setting, but it will soon be available in the clinical arena. To prepare for the challenges that these new advances will present, nurses must begin now to enhance their knowledge of genetics and its application to oncology.",Colon_Cancer
"Familial thyroid cancer can arise from parafollicular cells (familial medullary thyroid cancer) or from follicular cells (familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer). Familial medullary thyroid cancer may occur in isolation or as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type II syndromes. Genetic testing for a RET mutation on chromosome 10 is used to identify new family members who are gene carriers. Total thyroidectomy should be used in gene carriers without clinical disease before age 6 in medullary thyroid cancer and MEN type IIA, and as soon as the diagnosis is made in MEN type IIB after the first year of life. Those with clinical disease should have at least a bilateral central neck dissection. Modified radical neck dissection is recommended for patients when the primary tumor is 1.5 cm. A normal postoperative serum calcitonin level suggests that the operation has been curative. Physicians need to be aware of ethical and lifestyle issues related to patients with familial disease and their family members. Familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer occurs as a discrete entity or as part of other family cancer syndromes such as Gardner syndrome, Cowden disease, and other rare syndromes. Familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer almost exclusively includes patients with papillary or Hurthle cell cancers. These families appear to have more benign thyroid conditions. The gene (or genes) for familial papillary thyroid cancer is yet to be identified, whereas that for some Hurthle cells (TCO) has been mapped to chromosome 19p13.2. Familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer is somewhat more aggressive than its sporadic counterpart, but is less aggressive than medullary thyroid cancer. Total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection followed by radioactive iodine ablation and thyroid hormone suppression appear to be the most effective therapy.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Erythropoietin (Epo) and the epo-receptor (EpoR) have been implicated in tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. We previously demonstrated Epo and EpoR expression in a small group of archived papillary thyroid cancers (PTC), but were unable to examine functional integrity using formalin-fixed tissues. In the present study, we examined the in vitro expression, induction and function of Epo and EpoR in papillary (NPA), follicular (WRO) and anaplastic (ARO-81) thyroid cancer cells. We found that all three cell lines expressed Epo and EpoR mRNA and that the hypoxia-mimetic cobalt induced Epo expression in all cell lines. None of the growth factors we examined (thyrotropin, vascular endothelial growth factor, IGF-I, or human Epo) altered Epo or EpoR gene expression. Importantly, however, administration of Epo to NPA but not WRO cells resulted in significant alterations in the expression of several mitogenic genes including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), beta-casein (CSN2), wild type p53-induced gene-1 (WIG1) and cathepsin D (CTSD). Epo treated ARO-81 cells only had an increase in CSN2 expression. We conclude that Epo and EpoR are expressed by thyroid cancers and that stimulation of the Epo/EpoR signal pathway results in changes that could impact on the clinical behavior of thyroid cancers.",Thyroid_Cancer
"In summary, noninvasive clinical staging techniques aid in stratifying patients into similar prognostic and therapeutic categories. Every patient with presumed non-small cell lung cancer should undergo a thorough history and physical examination, basic routine laboratory testing, PA and lateral chest radiographs, and chest CT scan with upper abdominal cuts to allow evaluation of the liver and adrenals. Recently, FDG-PET scanning has shown tremendous promise in the noninvasive evaluation of the primary tumor, nodal involvement, and metastatic [table: see text] disease. Although valuable, clinical staging has limitations, and when pathologic confirmation of lung cancer is required, minimally invasive techniques, such as bronchoscopy, TTNA, thoracoscopy, anterior mediastinotomy, and cervical and extended mediastinoscopy, may be valuable and simple ways of obtaining tissue.",Lung_Cancer
"Familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) is a syndrome of familial clustering of thyroid cancers of follicular cell origin. It is characterized by multifocality, early onset, more recurrences, and a higher degree of aggressiveness than nonfamilial thyroid cancers of follicular cell origin. An autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with reduced penetrance appears likely in most pedigrees. Although several candidate genes responsible for isolated clinical variants of FNMTC have been identified in single families, the gene(s) responsible for the vast majority of FNMTC cases has yet to be identified. Members of FNMTC cohorts should be followed longitudinally with physical examination and ultrasonography, and aggressively treated when cancer is diagnosed. When cancer is diagnosed, total thyroidectomy should be performed, and most patients should have a prophylactic central neck dissection and a therapeutic lateral functional neck dissection, postoperative radioiodine ablation and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppressive therapy. Close follow-up with stimulated thyroglobulin levels, neck ultrasounds, and radioiodine scans are also central to the management strategy.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Recently, a variety of studies in vivo as well as in vitro have demonstrated that gastrointestinal hormones can influence the rate of proliferation of neoplastic cells. The widespread use of omeprazole, which increases serum gastrin, coupled with the findings that omeprazole causes gastric carcinoid tumors in rats and that a significant number of patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon have increased serum gastrin have focussed attention on the relationship between gastrin and colon cancer. In the present paper, we have reviewed the experimental findings in humans, experimental animals, and colon cancer cells in tissue culture that bear on the possible relationships between gastrin and colon cancer. Based on these findings, we have proposed two hypotheses that can account for the increased serum gastrin that occurs in some patients with colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Although colorectal cancer tissue is rich in pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase (PyNPase), there is no consensus as to whether cancer cells or stromal cells predominately express PyNPase.

The PyNPase expression level was higher in stromal cells than in cancer cells and the difference increased with inflammation induced by the immunostimulator OK432. These results suggest that stromal cells are the major PyNPase source in colorectal cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) has a unique role in cell cycle regulation, as it is crucial for cell cycle progression and cell division. The aim of the present study was to use a combination of various detection methods to examine the expression and clinical significance of CDK1 in thyroid cancer (THCA). We used in-house tissue microarrays, immunohistochemistry, public RNA-sequencing, gene microarrays, and meta-analyses to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the role of CDK1 in the occurrence and development of THCA. CDK1 protein expression was notably higher in THCA tissues than in non-cancer tissues as evidenced by the in-house tissue microarrays. The expression of CDK1 protein was also significantly higher in pathologic T3-T4 than in T1-T2 samples. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) for CDK1 was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.46-0.95) including a total of 931 THCA and 585 non-cancerous thyroid tissue samples. An aggregation of the immunohistochemistry results and the RNA-sequencing/microarray findings gave a pooled SMD for CDK1 expression of 2.13 (95% CI, 1.30-2.96). The final area under curve (AUC) for the summarized receiver operating characteristic (sROC) was 0.7941 using all 1102 cases of THCA and 672 cases of controls. KEGG analysis with the co-expressed genes of CDK1 in THCA demonstrated the top enriched pathways to be the cell cycle, thyroid hormone synthesis, autoimmune thyroid disease, etc. In summary, we reveal the overexpression of CDK1 in THCA based on multiple detection methods that combine independent cohorts. However, further studies are required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of CDK1 that promotes the biological aggressiveness of THCA cells.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Over the past 2 decades, scientific evidence has strongly supported the use of low-radiation dose chest computed tomography (CT) as a screening technique for lung cancer. This approach has resulted in a significant reduction in mortality rates by enabling the detection of early-stage lung cancer amenable to potentially curative treatments. Regarding diagnosis, there are also novel methods under study, such as liquid biopsy, identification of the pulmonary microbiome, and the use of artificial intelligence techniques, which will play a key role in the near future. At present, there is a growing trend towards less invasive surgical procedures, such as segmentectomy, as an alternative to lobectomy. This procedure is based on 2 recent clinical trials conducted on peripheral tumors measuring less than 2 cm. Although these approaches have demonstrated comparable survival rates, there remains controversy due to uncertainties surrounding recurrence rates and functional capacity preservation. With regard to adjuvant therapy, immunotherapy, either as a monotherapy or in conjunction with chemotherapy, has shown encouraging results in resectable stages of locally advanced lung cancer, demonstrating complete pathologic responses and improved overall survival.After surgery treatment, despite the lack of solid evidence for long-term follow-up of these patients, clinical practice recommends periodic CT scans during the early years.In conclusion, there have been significant advances in lung cancer that have improved diagnostic techniques using new technologies and screening programs.

"'Translational research' encompasses all activities that apply basic scientific research findings to clinical practice. Although it has taken almost 20 years since the first scientific discoveries, the approval of new 'drugs' such as Herceptin and Avastin represents a successful example. There has also been successful translation of science into the clinic in the field of otolaryngology. In the last decade, we have seen major developments in molecular biology and genetics. Two notable achievements have been the completion of the human genome project and the parallel advances in high-throughput molecular genomic and proteomic technologies. Linked with these events has been the enormous accumulation of new data which offers the promise of important future clinical applications. This review aims to discuss these major scientific developments, to demonstrate successes in thyroid translational research, and to summarise more recent research findings in thyroid disease which provide hope for the development of future clinical tools.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Screening for lung cancer serves to prevent deaths from this disease insofar as earlier resections are associated with higher rates of cure. There is good reason to believe that this is the case: in stage I, the 5-year survival rate with resection is 70%, whereas without resection the corresponding rate is only 10%. Before this evidence emerged, various authoritative organizations and agencies in North America advised against screening for lung cancer on the grounds of the results of several RCTs. As for CXR, I argue that the study results are consistent with up to 40% reduction in the fatality rate. Moreover, modern helical CT screening provides for detecting much smaller tumors than were detected in those studies. It is time to revoke the conclusion that screening for lung cancer does not serve to prevent deaths from this disease, and to quantify the usefulness of CT screening in particular. As for the requisite research, the prevailing orthodoxy has it that RCTs are to be used, but I argue that more meaningful results are obtainable, more rapidly and much less expensively, by the use of noncomparative (and hence unrandomized) studies.",Lung_Cancer

"Lung cancer is a global health burden and is among the most common and deadliest of all malignancies worldwide. The goal of screening programs is to detect tumors in earlier, curable stages, consequently reducing disease-specific mortality. The issue of screening has great relevance to thoracic surgeons, who should play a leading role in the debate over screening and its consequences. The burden is on thoracic surgeons to work in a multidisciplinary setting to guide and treat these patients safely and responsibly, ensuring low morbidity and mortality of potential diagnostic or therapeutic interventions.",Lung_Cancer
"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous, non-coding RNAs approximately 22 nucleotides in length that negatively regulate translation of the protein-coding genes. As such, miRNAs are fundamental mediators of cellular differentiation, proliferation, and survival. Each miRNA may functionally interact with a multitude of target genes to exert various effects on normal physiology to support human health or pathological processes leading to disease conditions, such as cancer. Genome-wide analyses have generated specific miRNA profiles of thyroid cancers (TCs) and identified the up- and down-regulated miRNAs related to various carcinogenesis stages and prognoses. Here, we summarize the recent knowledge on aberrant miRNA expression in the various TCs, including papillary, follicular, and other rare types. In addition, we discuss the significance of miRNA profiles and individual miRNAs in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of these tumors.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The role of autocrine growth factors in the stimulation of lung cancer growth is well established. Nicotine is an agonist for acetylcholine receptors and stimulates lung cancer growth. This suggests that if lung cancers synthesize acetylcholine (ACh), then ACh may be an autocrine growth factor for lung cancer. Analysis of normal lung demonstrated that the cells of origin of lung cancers express the proteins necessary for non-neuronal ACh storage and synthesis. Analysis of mRNA from squamous cell lung carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and adenocarcinoma showed synthesis of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and nicotinic receptors. Immunohistochemical analysis of a retrospective series of SCLC and adenocarcinomas showed that more than 50% of the lung cancers screened expressed ChAT and nicotinic receptors. To study the effect of endogenous ACh synthesis on growth, SCLC cell lines were studied. SCLC cell lines were found to express ChAT mRNA and to secrete ACh into the medium as measured by HPLC separation and enzymatically-coupled electrochemical detection. The SCLC cell line NCI-H82 synthesized highest levels of ACh. Showing that the endogenously synthesized ACh interacted with its receptors to stimulate cell growth, addition of muscarinic and nicotinic antagonists slowed H82 cell proliferation. These findings demonstrate that lung cancer cell lines synthesize and secrete ACh to act as an autocrine growth factor. The existence of a cholinergic autocrine loop in lung cancer provides a basis for understanding the effects of nicotine in cigarette smoke on lung cancer growth and provides a new pathway to investigate for potential therapeutic approaches to lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer

"Patients with clinically evident medullary thyroid cancer should have a total extracapsular thyroidectomy with bilateral central neck dissection and an ipsilateral prophylactic or therapeutic modified (functional) radical neck dissection when the primary tumor is greater than 1 cm and when the central neck nodes are positive. A prophylactic contralateral neck dissection should be done when the primary tumor is bilateral and when there is extensive lymphadenopathy on the side of the primary tumor. Patients who have gross, unresectable residual medullary thyroid cancer should receive postoperative external radiotherapy. Patients who are carriers of germ-line RET proto-oncogene point mutations or have an elevated (basal or stimulated) calcitonin levels on screening should have a prophylactic total thyroidectomy before age 6 years. In patients with an elevated basal or stimulated plasma calcitonin level and an intrathyroidal nodule on ultrasound, a total thyroidectomy and central neck lymph node dissection should be done. Patients with persistent or recurrent medullary thyroid cancer should have a complete thyroidectomy (if not done initially) and bilateral central and modified radical neck dissection, including upper mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Patients who are symptomatic from distant medullary thyroid cancer metastases (diarrhea, flushing, weight loss, or bone pain) should be treated with somatostatin analogs. Bone metastases should be resected if possible, and symptomatic lesions that are unresectable should be treated with external radiotherapy. Cytoreductive procedures such as radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation for liver metastases should be considered in symptomatic patients to reduce tumor burden. Localized pulmonary metastases should be resected.

"This conference focuses on the controversies about managing thyroid cancer, emphasizing the possibility that the treatment of patients with potentially fatal thyroid cancer may be improved. Although the mortality rate from thyroid cancer is low, it is the highest among cancers affecting the endocrine glands (excluding the ovary). Exposure to radiation during childhood in the 1930s and 1940s increased the incidence of but not the mortality from thyroid cancer, because these tumors are mainly papillary cancers developing in young adults. These rates may change as the exposed cohort ages. Risk factors that increase mortality include older patient age and the growth characteristics of the tumor at diagnosis, the presence of distant metastases, and cell type (for example, the tall-cell variants of papillary cancer, follicular cancer [to be distinguished from the more benign follicular variant of papillary cancer], medullary cancer, and anaplastic cancer). Local metastases in lymph nodes do not seem to increase the risk for death from papillary cancer, but they do increase the risk for death from follicular and medullary cancer. In the latter, mortality is decreased by the early detection and treatment of patients with the familial multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome 2a. There are excellent tumor markers for differentiated cancer of the parafollicular and of the follicular cells (serum calcitonin and serum thyroglobulin levels, respectively). Measuring the calcitonin level allows early diagnosis of familial medullary cancer, whereas measuring the thyroglobulin level, although useful only after total thyroidectomy, allows early recognition of recurrence or metastases of papillary or follicular cancer. Initial surgery, protocols for follow-up, and the use of radioiodine for the ablation of any residual thyroid and the treatment of metastatic cancer are discussed. Because these tumors resist currently available chemotherapy regimens, possible ways to increase the effectiveness of radioiodine therapy are considered as are new approaches to treatment.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Glucose-regulating protein 78 (GRP78) is a molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that promotes folding and assembly of proteins, controls the quality of proteins, and regulates ER stress signaling through Ca2+ binding to the ER.

Increasing evidence has shown that GRP78 is closely associated with the progression and poor prognosis of lung cancer, and plays an important role in the treatment of lung cancer. Herein, we reviewed for the first time the functions and mechanisms of GRP78 in the pathological processes of lung cancer, including tumorigenesis, apoptosis, autophagy, progression, and drug resistance, giving a comprehensive understanding of the function of GRP78 in lung cancer. In addition, we also discussed the potential role of GRP78 as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for lung cancer, which is conducive to improving the assessment of lung cancer and the development of new therapeutic interventions.",Lung_Cancer

"Artificial intelligence is advancing rapidly and making its way into all areas of our lives. This review discusses developments and potential practices regarding the use of artificial intelligence in the field of ophthalmology, and the related topic of medical ethics. Various artificial intelligence applications related to the diagnosis of eye diseases were researched in books, journals, search engines, print and social media. Resources were cross-checked to verify the information. Artificial intelligence algorithms, some of which were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, have been adopted in the field of ophthalmology, especially in diagnostic studies. Studies are being conducted that prove that artificial intelligence algorithms can be used in the field of ophthalmology, especially in diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and retinopathy of prematurity. Some of these algorithms have come to the approval stage. The current point in artificial intelligence studies shows that this technology has advanced considerably and shows promise for future work. It is believed that artificial intelligence applications will be effective in identifying patients with preventable vision loss and directing them to physicians, especially in developing countries where there are fewer trained professionals and physicians are difficult to reach.

"Lung tumors are one of the most aggressive threats affecting humans. Current therapeutic approaches have improved patients' survival; however, further efforts are required to increase effectiveness and protection against tumor relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapy presents an alternative to previous treatments that focuses on stimulating of the patient's immune system to destroy tumor cells. Viruses can be used as part of the immune therapeutic approach as agents that could selectively infect tumor cells, triggering an immune response against the infection and against the tumor cells. Some viruses have been selected for specifically infecting and destroying cancer cells, activating the immune response, enhancing access, amplifying the cytotoxicity against the tumor cells, and improving the long-term memory that can prevent tumor relapse. Oncolytic virotherapy can then be used as a strategy to target the destruction of transformed cells at the tumor site and act in locations distant from the primary targeted tumor site. Some of the current challenges in lung cancer treatment can be addressed using traditional therapies combined with oncolytic virotherapy. Defining the best combination, including the choice of the right settings will be at the next frontier in lung cancer treatment.",Lung_Cancer
"Colorectal cancer is the third most often encountered type of cancer and represents the third leading cause of cancer related deaths, on both sexes. One of the most important prognostic parameters is the tumor's stage at the time of the diagnosis. T4 cancers represent advanced tumors associated with penetration of the visceral peritoneum (T4a) and/or direct invasion in adjacent structures (T4b). Preoperative diagnosis is influenced by the inability of the existent imaging modalities to accurately differentiate the true invasion from the simple, inflammatory adherence to the neighboring structures. As a consequence surgical treatment must follow the principle of en bloc resection; however the ability of achieving an R0 resection depends on the tumor location, invaded organ, and the type of the surgical procedure required. Neoadjuvant treatment for advanced colon cancer it may be very difficult to be applied.

"A hospital-based case-control study on the possible relationship between cholecystectomy and colon cancer is described. In all, 569 cases and 1,129 controls were included in the study. Controls were patients who had been admitted either with another malignant disease (lung cancer or breast cancer), or because of benign gastrointestinal diseases. No differences with regard to colon cancer risk were observed between the two control groups. The crude odds ratio (OR) after cholecystectomy for colon cancer was 2.1 [95% CL (confidence limits) = 1.5; 2.9]. No significant difference in risk between males (OR = 2.0; 95% CL = 1.1; 3.6) and females (OR = 2.1; 95% CL = 1.4; 3.2) was found. A significant inverse relationship was found between the relative risk for colon cancer and sublocalization of the colon cancer, the highest relative risk (RR) found proximal in the colon. A decreasing risk with increasing interval between cholecystectomy and date of diagnosis of colon cancer was found. It is hypothesized that the apparent association between cholecystectomy and colon cancer does not reflect a necessary cause-effect relationship, but is rather an epiphenomenon representing a diminished exposure level to other etiologic factors.",Colon_Cancer

"Lenvatinib (Lenvima ) is an oral, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1, 2 and 3, fibroblast growth factor receptors 1, 2, 3 and 4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha, and RET and KIT signalling networks, which are implicated in tumour growth and maintenance. In the EU and USA, lenvatinib is indicated for the treatment of locally recurrent or metastatic progressive, radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC). This approval was based on the results of the randomized, double-blind, multinational, phase 3 SELECT study, in which lenvatinib significantly improved median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate compared with placebo in patients with RR-DTC. The PFS benefit with lenvatinib was seen in all pre-specified subgroups, including patients who had received either one or no prior VEGF-targeted therapy. Moreover, the PFS benefit with lenvatinib was maintained regardless of BRAF or RAS mutation status. The safety and tolerability profile of lenvatinib in SELECT was consistent with that of other VEGF/VEGF receptor-targeted therapies and was mostly manageable. Hypertension was the most common treatment-related adverse event in lenvatinib-treated patients, but only infrequently led to discontinuation of the drug. Although not collected in SELECT, information on quality of life would be useful in assessing the overall impact of therapy on the patient. This notwithstanding, the data which are available indicate that lenvatinib is an effective and generally well-tolerated treatment option for patients with RR-DTC.

"Localized resection of early stage colon cancer is increasingly technically feasible by truly minimally invasive means. Such techniques as endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (N.O.T.E.S.) now raise the prospect of focused intraluminal and transmural resection of small primary tumors without abdominal wall transgression. The potential clinical benefit that patients may accrue from targeted dissection as definitive treatment in place of radical operation is not yet definitively proven but may be considerable at least in the short-term. However, oncological propriety and outcomes must be maintained. In particular methods by which regional nodal staging can be assured if standard operation is avoided need still to be established. Sentinel node mapping is one such putative means of doing so that deserves serious consideration from this perspective as it performs a similar function for breast cancer and melanoma and because there is already considerable evidence to suggest the technique in colonic neoplasia may be at its most accurate in germinal disease. In addition, it may already be employed by laparoscopy while solely transluminal means of its deployment are advancing. While the confluence of operative technologies and techniques now coming on-stream has the potential to precipitate a dramatic shift in the paradigm for the management of early stage colonic neoplasia, considerable confirmatory study is required to ensure that oncology propriety and treatment efficacy is maintained so that patient benefit may be maximized.",Colon_Cancer

"BRAFV600E is a constitutively active onco-kinase and is the most common genetic alteration in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), and in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma as well, albeit at a lower frequency. The BRAFV600E mutation in some studies has been significantly associated with extra-thyroidal extension, metastases, recurrence, and mortality in patients with PTC. A recent genome-wide expression profiling approach (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)) and in vitro and in vivo functional studies revealed that BRAFV600E affects extracellular matrix composition (i.e. increased expression of some collagens and laminins) and promotes thyroid cancer migration and invasion. BRAFV600E through the phospho-MEK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 pathway may control a network of genes crucial in integrating and regulating the extracellular and intracellular signaling in thyroid cancer cells, which may be fundamental to trigger an abnormal cell differentiation/totipotency and shape/polarity, and contribute to tumor aggressiveness mechanisms (i.e. cell adhesion, migration, and invasion). Increasing our knowledge of BRAFV600E-modulated ECM genes and targeting the subset of genes essential for tumor aggressiveness will help establish a novel paradigm for treatment of thyroid cancers harboring BRAFV600E. Furthermore, identifying downstream events from the BRAFV600E/ERK1/2 pathway will eventually identify novel biomarkers that can be used to correlate with disease outcome and overall survival.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Lung cancer is a leading cancer site in men and women with a high incidence and mortality rate. Most patients are diagnosed when the disease has already spread. An early, detection and immediate and accurate histological or cytological diagnosis are essential for a hopeful outcome. In most patients, bronchoscopy is the method of choice in establishing a suspected lung neoplasm. With the rigid and flexible method, two complementary techniques are available. The methods bear a very low mortality rate if sufficient monitoring and resuscitative instrumentation is available. Rigid bronchoscopy offers the possibility of obtaining large biopsy specimens from the tumorous tissue and provides an effective tool in the control of major haemorrhage. However, it cannot be used for the inspection of further peripherally located parts of the bronchial system and needs general anaesthesia. In contrast, the flexible method can be quickly and readily performed at practically any location using portable equipment.

"The majority of thyroid carcinomas are removed surgically. The appropriate surgical technique is still debated. After surgery the amount of residual thyroid or tumour and the presence of local or distant metastases is often in doubt, particularly if it is not detectable clinically. Therefore, methods for determining the presence of disease or the later recurrence of disease are needed. They commonly include serum thyroglobulin and imaging after diagnostic or therapeutic doses of 131I. Other techniques are used such as 131I whole body retention (using a whole body counter), 201Tl and 99Tcm-sestamibi imaging. The place of these diagnostic methods in the management of thyroid cancer is reviewed in this article. Radioiodine would seem an ideal treatment for recurrence of functioning thyroid carcinoma as 131I targets the lesion and has minimal side effects. However, the indolent nature of well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas makes it difficult to assess the benefits of radioiodine therapy both in its ability to ablate the normal thyroid and to treat recurrent and metastatic disease. However, the addition of radioiodine therapy to local surgical removal reduces both the occurrence of metastases and the morbidity with prolonged follow-up. Unresolved issues that remain concern the activities of radioiodine needed to achieve adequate ablation of residual thyroid tissue and to treat residual and recurrent cancer. There is also debate as to exactly which patients require radioiodine therapy. This review also considers radiation protection and the side effects of 131I therapy.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Papillary thyroid cancer is the most common neoplasm of the thyroid gland. Surgical resection is the cornerstone of therapy. There is controversy regarding the extent of resection, ranging from thyroid lobectomy plus isthmusectomy to total thyroidectomy, but in experienced hands total thyroidectomy has many significant advantages over a lesser operation. Nonoperative therapy has no role as primary therapy for papillary thyroid cancer, but can be used in conjunction with surgery to improve outcome. Radioiodine in patients who have received total thyroidectomy can be used to identify residual occult tumor, recurrence, and metastasis, and can also be used to ablate the neoplasm, resulting in a substantial cure rate. Thyroid hormone is needed as replacement after total thyroidectomy, but can also be given as thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression, which may have an adjunctive benefit after resection.",Thyroid_Cancer

"The number of patients with early lung cancer, which is detected by screening high risk group for lung cancer using sputum cytology, or by screening using CT is increasing. Recent studies have shown that some histologic types of early peripheral adenocarcinoma have no lymph node involvement. In addition, the incidence of multicentricity of peripheral type of early adenocarcinoma, detected by meticulous evaluation of CT images, is not so low. Video-assisted limited resection may be feasible in such cases. In spite of the excellent results of surgical resection for the hilar type of early lung cancer, surgery is at risk in some patients because of underlying pulmonary dysfunction and of a high incidence of second primary lung cancers.

"Lung cancer represents an increasingly frequent cancer diagnosis worldwide. An increasing awareness on smoking cessation as an important mean to reduce lung cancer incidence and mortality, an increasing number of therapy options and a steady focus on early diagnosis and adequate staging have resulted in a modestly improved survival. For early diagnosis and precise staging, imaging, especially positron emission tomography combined with CT (PET/CT), plays an important role. Other functional imaging modalities such as dynamic contrast-enhanced CT (DCE-CT) and diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DW-MRI) have demonstrated promising results within this field. The purpose of this review is to provide the reader with a brief and balanced introduction to these three functional imaging modalities and their current or potential application in the care of patients with lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer

"Thyroid carcinomas represent a challenging problem from the prognostic standpoint. Despite an overall good prognosis of the most frequent endocrine malignancy, 10-15 % of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) turn refractory to radioactive iodine therapy. The increased incidence of thyroid cancer has led to the search for solid prognostic biomarkers that predict the behaviour of these tumours. Clinical and histopathological prognostic factors remain the only safe elements to be used for diagnosis and prognosis of patients with thyroid tumours. Despite the huge amount of genetic information of thyroid tumours, very few new markers revealed diagnostic or prognostic value per se. BRAF mutation can have some value if associated to other clinico-pathological parameters, or in the particular setting of iodine refractory tumours. Others can prove interesting in the future as predictive biomarkers of therapeutic response, but more studies are needed to confirm these potential biomarkers.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The immune system plays critical roles in tumor prevention, but also in its initiation and progression. Tumors are subjected to immunosurveillance, but cancer cells generate an immunosuppressive microenvironment that favors their escape from immune-mediated elimination. During chronic inflammation, immune cells can contribute to the formation and progression of tumors by producing mitogenic, prosurvival, proangiogenic and lymphangiogenic factors.

In this review, we discuss recent findings on how different immune cells and mediators can contribute to thyroid cancer development and progression.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Colon cancer is one of the major leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the Western countries. In Korea, the incidence of colon cancer is increasing due to changes in environment and lifestyle such as diet. Chemoprevention strategy using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been under intensive clinical and epidemiological research as these drugs suppress colorectal cancer. The best known targets of NSAIDs are cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxane. Among these PGs, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) can promote tumor growth by binding its receptors and activating signal pathways which control cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Therefore, COX inhibition is promising approach for chemoprevention of colorectal cancer. However, the prolonged use of COX-2 inhibitors is associated with unacceptable cardiovascular side effects. Thus, new targets involved in PGs metabolism are under investigation. 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), a key metabolic enzyme of PGE2, was up-regulated in normal colonic epithelium, but decreased in colon cancer. Recent findings suggest that 15-PGDH is involved in the neoplastic progression of initiated colonic epithelial cells. Also, new players related with PGs metabolism including prostaglandin transporter (PGT) and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES) were reported to play a role in colorectal cancer development. This review presents current knowledge about the role of prostaglandins and associated proteins in colorectal cancer development and progression.",Colon_Cancer

"Lymph node metastases are important determinants in the prognosis of primary colorectal cancer. Although it has been established that enlarged, palpable lymph nodes contain metastases in less than half of the cases, no definitive data concerning the incidence of metastases in lymph nodes measuring 5 mm or less are available. We treated the surgical specimens of 52 consecutive patients who had colon cancer with a lymph node clearance technique at the Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo. We found 2699 lymph nodes in the 52 specimens, with a mean of 52 lymph nodes per specimen (range, five to 151). Sixty-four lymph nodes were found with metastases in 21 (40%) of the 52 patients. Fifty-nine of 64 of the lymph nodes were reexamined and remeasured. Thirty-nine lymph node metastases measured less than 5 mm, 13 were between 5 and 10 mm, and eight were larger than 10 mm. We concluded that lymph node metastases in colon cancer occur most frequently in lymph nodes measuring less than 5 mm (small lymph nodes). The use of lymph node clearing techniques in surgical specimens improves detection of small lymph node metastases and thereby diminishes understaging.",Colon_Cancer
"Colon cancers arise from benign neoplasms and evolve into adenocarcinomas through a stepwise histological progression sequence, proceeding from either adenomas or hyperplastic polyps/serrated adenomas. Genetic alterations have been associated with specific steps in this polyp-adenocarcinoma sequence and are believed to drive the histological progression of colon cancer. Recently, epigenetic alterations, which include CGI (CpG island) DNA methylation, have been shown to occur in colon polyps and colon cancer. The aberrant methylation of genes appears to co-operate with the genetic alterations to drive the initiation and progression of colon polyps to colon cancer. CGI DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that represses gene transcription in normal cellular processes, but it becomes excessive and aberrant in many neoplasms. The aberrant DNA methylation affects CpG-rich regions, called CGIs, in the 5' region of genes and results in transcriptional silencing through effects on transcription factor binding and associated changes in chromatin structure. These hypermethylated genes are not only probable pathogenic events affecting colon-cancer formation, but also neoplasm-specific molecular events that may be useful as molecular markers for colon tumours. Furthermore, aberrant DNA methylation of tumour-suppressor genes may occur secondary to a genetic predisposition or to a field-cancerization effect in the colon and may be useful as molecular markers for the risk of developing colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Colon cancer is a public health problem worldwide. Although potentially curable at early stages, a substantial number of patients will inevitably present with or eventually develop metastatic disease, which is often incurable. Despite the progress achieved with the introduction of new cytotoxic agents, recurrence rates for patients with resected stage II/III disease remain > 20%. Therefore, a great deal of effort and resources have been put into improving early diagnosis and prevention tools as well as the efficacy of adjuvant treatment. Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is now considered the standard of care in node-positive colon cancer, but there remains controversy with regard to the indication and type of adjuvant treatment in patients with nodenegative disease. Oral fluoropyrimidines play a growing role in the management of colorectal cancer and can be currently considered an alternative to 5-fluorouracil. Numerous reports have suggested that elderly patients benefit equally from chemotherapy, but the growing numbers of octogenarian and nonagenarian patients in our clinics, many of whom occasionally struggle through treatment, are a reminder of the challenges ahead. Finally, as we might have reached a plateau in terms of cytotoxic chemotherapy, numerous clinical trials are now focusing on the role of biologic agents in the adjuvant setting.",Colon_Cancer

"A variety of promising gene therapy approaches have been examined for treatment of follicular cell-derived and medullary thyroid cancer, including corrective gene therapy, cytoreductive gene therapy as well as immunomodulatory gene therapy. In addition, cloning of the NIS gene has provided us with a powerful cytoreductive gene therapy strategy based on targeted NIS gene transfer followed by radionculide ((131)I, (188)Re, (211)At) therapy. The data summarized in this article clearly demonstrate the high potential of currently available gene therapy approaches for future therapy of advanced dedifferentiated and medullary thyroid cancer, in particular as part of a multimodality approach. One of the major hurdles on the way to clinical application of gene therapy approaches in metastasized thyroid cancer is optimal tumor-specific targeting in the presence of low toxicity. Replication-selective viral vectors and novel biodegradable polymers as highly efficient nonviral vectors seem to be most promising candidates for the development of efficient and safe systemic gene therapy strategies. The bystander effect that is associated with some of the above listed gene therapy strategies provides a powerful means to compensate for the limited tumor spread of viral and nonviral vectors. Based on its dual function as therapy and reporter gene allowing noninvasive imaging by (123)I-scintigraphy and (124)I-PET imaging, NIS gene therapy offers the advantage of detailed characterization of in vivo vector biodistribution as well as localization, level, and duration of transgene expression - an essential prerequisite for exact planning and monitoring of clinical gene therapy trials with the aim of individualized therapy.",Thyroid_Cancer

Screening should be performed in the context of a multidisciplinary program experienced in the diagnosis and management of lung nodules and early-stage lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer
"Thyroid cancer encompasses some forms that practically have no identifiable mortality to one of the most lethal soft tissue cancers known. Because of this variation, a knowledge of the role that age, histology, and extent of disease play in establishing a prognosis is necessary to provide a rational therapeutic program. Younger patients (under age 40) with differentiated cancer, even those with lymph node metastases, should not be overtreated with extensive surgery and 131I or external beam therapy because the prognosis in these patients is so extremely good. Thyroid hormone suppression is probably adequate therapy for patients in this group after obvious disease has been resected. Recurrences can usually be effectively treated with 131I. On the other hand, older patients should be treated more aggressively, especially with the routine use of 131I ablation and therapy after resection of disease. Radiation therapy as described for recurrent disease should be considered at an early point and should be used immediately once the diagnosis of anaplastic cancer has been established. Finally, patience and observation alone should be considered a good therapeutic alternative, for example, in hypercalcitoninemic patients with medullary cancer that has been apparently adequately resected. Repeat operations in these patients fail to eliminate elevated serum calcitonin levels in the majority of cases, and the patients may live for many years with a good quality of life.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Currently, metastatic colon cancer is treated with monotherapeutic regimens such as folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CapeOX), and leucovorin, fluorouracil, and irinotecan hydrochloride (FOLFIRI). Other treatments include biological therapies and immunotherapy with drugs such as bevacizumab, panitumumab, cetuximab, and pembrolizumab. After the research, it was found that some mutations make those treatments not as effective in all patients. In this bibliographic review, we investigated the pharmacogenetic explanations for how mutations in the genes coding for rat sarcoma virus (RAS) and rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) reduce the effectiveness of these treatments and allow the continued proliferation of tumors. Furthermore, we note that patients with mutations in the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPDY) gene usually require lower doses of therapies such as 5-fluorouracyl (5-FU) and capecitabine to avoid severe adverse effects. Some other mutations in the thymidylate synthase gene (TSYM), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR), and ATP binding cassette transporter B (ABCB1 and ABCB2) affect efficacy and security of the treatments. It is important to address the clinical implication of the oncologist in the study of gene mutations than can influence in the antitumoral response and safety of colon cancer treatments.",Colon_Cancer
"Colon cancer is a major health problem in industrialized countries. It ranks at the first place among digestive cancers, with a sex ratio of 1. Colon cancer incidence increased between 1975 and 2005. France belongs to high risk countries for colorectal cancers. Since eighties, there was a progressive switch from left to right colon cancers. Owing to its frequency, and its epidemiological characteristics, colorectal cancer is, in France, justifiable of a national population-based mass screening. In France, national screening relies on biennial testing in subjects between 50 and 74 followed by total colonoscopy in case of positive test. In order to decrease significantly colorectal cancer mortality participation rate has to be over 50%. The colorectal cancer mortality decrease in this case varies between 15 and 28% in the general population, and between 33 and 39% among participants to screening.

"Folate is essential for proliferating cells and folate transport pathways and folate-dependent metabolic processes show promise as targets for anti-neoplastic therapy. Folate receptor (FOLR1), a folate transporter, is an attractive target for anti-neoplastic therapy due to its high affinity for folate, restricted range of expression in normal tissue and differential over-expression in malignant tissue. FOLR1 is expressed in non-small cell lung cancer, with a higher expression in adenocarcinoma compared with squamous cell carcinoma. Farletuzumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting FOLR1 which in pre-clinical studies led to cytotoxicity of FOLR1-expressing cells, inhibited tumor growth in animal models and showed limited reactivity with normal tissue.

"In an attempt to define the type and temporal sequences of somatic genetic changes that precede the onset of invasive lung cancer, and to search for biological markers useful in screening multiple primary tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract, we have performed a cytogenetic and genetic study using normal bronchial epithelium and primary tumor specimens of 68 patients undergoing pulmonary resection for early stage lung cancer, and normal bronchial epithelium of 5 controls with metastatic sarcomas. Of the 68 lung cancer cases, 31 had a single tumor and 37 displayed multiple synchronous or metachronous tumors. Cytogenetic alterations were observed in 59% (23/39) of the evaluable tumor specimens with complex rearranged karyotypes, particularly involving chromosomes 3 (70%), 17 (39%), 11 (26%), 8, 9, 12 (22%), and 7 (17%). Gene alterations were also detected including overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in 63% (36/57), HER2/NEU in 21% (12/56), and p53 mutations in 50% (12/24). The overall frequency of genetic changes (any type) in the tumors was 76% (52/68).

"A retrospective study involving 706 sample cases of large bowel cancer grouped by subsite (ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, ana rectum), sex, and age identified during the Third National Cancer Survey (Pittsburgh SMSA, 1969--1971) was recently completed. The basic strategy of this comparative study was to determine whether the frequency distribution patterns of both demorgraphic characteristics and environmental factors differed among persons with subsite-specific cancer of the large bowel. Based on the information provided in the hospital records there was a gradient of previous cholecystectomy history from ascending colon cancer (10.5%) to rectal cancer (2.1%) in those patient records whose only gastrointestinal surgery indicated was cholecystectomy. For patient records in which the only surgical operation was cholecystectomy, or cholecystectomy plus other gastrointestinal surgery, the gradient persisted as one moved from the right to the left subsites of the large bowel. No relationship with respect to other types of gastrointestinal surgery was observed. It is clear, however, that a bias associated with the review of hospital records can account for this relationship and, therefore, the finding may be spurious. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence of a relationship between bile acid metabolism and carcinoma of the colon. It might be considered that the right side of the colon would be most likely affected by the potential carcinogenic effect of certain bile acid metabolites.",Colon_Cancer
"Epidemiology of thyroid cancer. There is an important increase in the frequency of thyroid cancer in France, even after taking into account population increase and aging. This increase is essentially due to overdiagnosis. Overdiagnosis is the detection of a cancer which would never have become symptomatic during the lifetime of the person; it transforms a healthy individual into a patient. Autopsy studies show that more than 10% of the population carries cancer cells in their thyroid gland, and that this proportion is the same among men and among women. The greater frequency of thyroid cancer among women is therefore the consequence of their more frequent interactions with clinicians at a younger age, for themself or for their children.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Four types of thyroid cancer comprise more than 98% of all thyroid malignancies. Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) may have a very benign course while undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (UTC) belongs to the most aggressive human malignancies. A variety of genes have been identified to be involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid carcinoma. Somatic Ras mutations seem to be an early event and are frequently found in follicular thyroid carcinomas. Somatic rearrangements of RET and TRK are almost exclusively found in PTC and may be found in early stages. Germline RET missense mutations lead to hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). In contrast, the significance of somatic RET mutations in sporadic MTC is unknown. p53 seems to play a crucial role in the dedifferentiation process of thyroid carcinoma. The precise role of PTEN remains to be elucidated. The only clearly identified exogenous factor that may lead to thyroid carcinoma (mainly PTC) is radiation. Of interest, radiation is capable to induce RET rearrangements. In general, early diagnosis is mandatory to enable the chance of cure. Surgery is the treatment of choice. Depending on the tumour type, surgery in combination with either radioiodine, external radiation or chemotherapy often enables the control of local tumour burden. In MTC and UTC, once thyroid cancer is spread to distant organs, efficacious therapeutic agents are almost non-existing. However, our growing knowledge of genes involved in thyroidal oncogenesis may contribute to the development of more effective treatment modalities. Some preliminary data on gene therapy are quite promising.",Thyroid_Cancer

"The brain is one of the most complex living tissue types and is composed of an exceptional diversity of cell types displaying unique functional connectivity. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be used to efficiently map the molecular identities of the various cell types in the brain by providing the transcriptomic profiles of individual cells isolated from the tissue. However, the lack of spatial context in scRNA-seq prevents a comprehensive understanding of how different configurations of cell types give rise to specific functions in individual brain regions and how each distinct cell is connected to form a functional unit. To understand how the various cell types contribute to specific brain functions, it is crucial to correlate the identities of individual cells obtained through scRNA-seq with their spatial information in intact tissue. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) can resolve the complex spatial organization of cell types in the brain and their connectivity. Various ST tools developed during the past decade based on imaging and sequencing technology have permitted the creation of functional atlases of the brain and have pulled the properties of neural circuits into ever-sharper focus.

"The transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) has an important regulatory role in tumorigenesis, but its implication in thyroid cancer has not been yet investigated. In the present study, we have analyzed the expression of YY1 in differentiated thyroid cancer and assessed the association of YY1 expression with clinical features. Expression of YY1 was evaluated in human thyroid cancer cell lines, a series of matched normal/tumor thyroid tissues and in a thyroid cancer tissue microarray, using real-time PCR, Western blot, and/or immunohistochemistry. YY1 was overexpressed in thyroid cancer cells, at transcription and protein levels. A significant increase of YY1 mRNA was also observed in tumor thyroid tissues. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis of the thyroid cancer tissue microarray revealed that both papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) present increased YY1 protein levels (48 and 19%, respectively). After stratification by the level of YY1 protein, positive YY1 expression identifies 88% of patients with PTC. The association of YY1 expression with clinicopathological features in PTC and FTC showed that YY1 expression was related with age at diagnosis. Our data indicates for the first time overexpression of YY1 in differentiated thyroid cancer, with YY1 being more frequently overexpressed in the PTC subtype.",Thyroid_Cancer
"From 1956 to 1975 21 patients (13 females and 8 males) with thyroid cancer developed by age 14 have been observed at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan.

There are no precise recommendations for lower-risk mutations, for which the surgical decision also depends on the calcitonin level and family history. We describe 18 patients who underwent prophylactic surgery. Regardless of the mutation, all patients with a normal preoperative calcitonin level were cured. However, surgery was performed later than recommended, for various reasons, including late genetic diagnosis and parents' opposition.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The international tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system is the ""international language"" in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Six revisions of the TNM staging system for lung cancer have been repeated over the past 35 years after the beginning of UICC-TNM classification in 1968. The 1997 revision for lung cancer has undergone an extensive correction for many deficiencies of the old staging system. As a result, the new staging system appears to be a great improvement over previous editions. There are, however, still some controversies and proposals for revising, even when the new staging system is applied in daily diagnoses and treatment for lung cancer. In the present paper, these problems are presented and discussed. Main subjects for discussions are as follows: (1). Since the 2nd revision, T1 and T2 lesions were divided at the border of a 3 cm tumor size. Is 3 cm diameter an appropriate cut-off point for dividing T1 and T2 lesions? (2). Is it valid to subdivide T1 and T2 lesions into each A and B? (3). Is it appropriate to down-stage all of T3N0M0 to stage IIB, because there exists heterogeneity of T3? (4). Definitions of T4 lesion. (5). Controversies in three kinds of lymph node maps. Especially, where there is a boundary between N1 and N2 station in each map? (6) How to classify separate tumor nodules (STN) in the same lobe, and in the non-primary lobe. (7) Controversy exists concerning the validity of present stage grouping, because there are no significant difference of survivals between IB and IIA, IIA and IIB in most reports and also between T3N0M0 and T3N1M0 in some reports.",Lung_Cancer
"Technological advancements in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), particularly the integration of diverse stakeholder groups (communication service providers, road operators, automakers, repairers, CAV consumers, and the general public) and the pursuit of new economic opportunities, have resulted in the emergence of new technical, legal, and social challenges. The most pressing challenge is deterring criminal behaviour in both the physical and cyber realms through the adoption of CAV cybersecurity protocols and regulations. However, the literature lacks a systematic decision tool to analyze the impact of the potential cybersecurity regulations for dynamically interacting stakeholders, and to identify the leverage points to minimise the cyber-risks. To address this knowledge gap, this study uses systems theory to develop a dynamic modelling tool to analyze the indirect consequences of potential CAVs cybersecurity regulations in the medium to long term. It is hypothesized that CAVs Cybersecurity Regulatory Framework (CRF) is the property of the entire ITS stakeholders. The CRF is modelled using the System Dynamic based Stock-and-Flow-Model (SFM) technique. The SFM is founded on five critical pillars: the Cybersecurity Policy Stack, the Hacker's Capability, Logfiles, CAV Adopters, and intelligence-assisted traffic police. It is found that decision-makers should focus on three major leverage points: establishing a CRF grounded on automakers' innovation; sharing risks in eliminating negative externalities associated with underinvestment and knowledge asymmetries in cybersecurity; and capitalising on massive CAV-generated data in CAV operations. The formal integration of intelligence analysts and computer crime investigators to strengthen traffic police capabilities is pivotal. Recommendations for automakers include data-profiteering in CAV design, production, sales, marketing, safety enhancements and enabling consumer data transparency.Furthermore, CAVs-CRF necessitate a balanced approach to the trade-off between: i) data accessibility constraints on CAV automakers and ITS service providers; ii) regulator command and control thresholds; iii) automakers' business investment protection; and iv) consumers' data privacy guard.",Generic
"Because lung cancer frequently presents in an advanced stage when it is incurable, there has been a sustained search for an early diagnosis approach that could detect lung cancer when curable, while having few secondary consequences. Decades of research have evaluated various approaches to lung screening, including routine chest radiograph, sputum cytology, and, most recently, computed tomography (CT) scanning. No study has suggested that any of these approaches will identify life-threatening lung cancers at an earlier disease stage and allow alteration of their natural history. Therefore, no recommending body or professional society recommends using any of these approaches to screen for lung cancer. This general recommendation could change if randomized trials examining CT screening suggest that its benefits outweigh its harms.",Lung_Cancer
"Over 100,000 Americans are diagnosed each year with colon cancer and approximately 90% are treated surgically. Most undergo a curative intent resection, but 30 to 50 percent will have a recurrence of their disease. While much of the variability in outcomes depends on the stage of the disease and other tumor variables, it is now clear that surgeon variables such as caseload and training affect both local recurrence and patient survival. Operative techniques including laparoscopic and other minimally invasive procedures and surgical decisions including choice of operative procedure, management of cancer arising in polyps and treatment of metastatic disease affect outcomes. The role of postoperative surveillance for recurrence remains controversial.",Colon_Cancer
"Glycosylation is an important protein modification in all eukaryotes. Whereas the early asparagine-linked glycosylation (N-glycosylation) and N-glycan processing steps in the endoplasmic reticulum are conserved between mammals and plants, the maturation of complex N-glycans in the Golgi apparatus differs considerably. Due to a restricted number of Golgi-resident N-glycan processing enzymes and the absence of nucleotide sugars such as CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid, plants produce only a limited repertoire of different N-glycan structures. Moreover, mammalian mucin-type O-glycosylation of serine or threonine residues has not been described in plants and the required machinery is not encoded in their genome which enables de novo build-up of the pathway. As a consequence, plants are very well-suited for the production of homogenous N- and O-glycans and are increasingly used for the production of recombinant glycoproteins with custom-made glycans that may result in the generation of biopharmaceuticals with improved therapeutic potential.",Generic
"Best practices from open data science are spreading across research fields, providing new opportunities for research and education. Open data science emphasizes the view that digitalization is enabling new forms of resource sharing, collaboration and outreach. This has the potential to improve the overall transparency and efficiency of research. Microbiome bioinformatics is a rapidly developing area that can greatly benefit from this progress. The concept of microbiome data science refers to the application of best practices from open data science to microbiome bioinformatics. The increasing availability of open data and new opportunities to collaborate online are greatly facilitating the development of this field. A microbiome data science ecosystem combines experimental research data with open data processing and analysis and reproducible tutorials that can also serve as an educational resource. Here, we provide an overview of the current status of microbiome data science from a community developer perspective and propose directions for future development of the field.",Generic
"Laparoscopic resection of the colon is certainly feasible. There are conflicting reports regarding decreased postoperative pain, resumption of gastrointestinal function, and earlier return to work. There is no change in either mortality or morbidity when compared with open resection. For benign disease laparoscopic colonic resection is ideal if performed by a surgeon who performs the operation frequently. For malignant disease, [table: see text] at this stage, laparoscopic colonic resection should only be performed in the setting of a randomized controlled trial. The future of laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer will be decided by oncologic parameters. There is good evidence that a laparoscopic resection can be technically equivalent to its open counterpart. The data on recurrence, both local and distant, and long-term survival will become clearer when results of randomized controlled trials currently underway become available. The issue of port-site recurrence is a major concern in laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery. The reported incidence is low; however, its cause remains unexplained and its presence in patients with early stage tumors cannot be ignored.",Colon_Cancer

"During the last two decades, the understanding of molecular biology of thyroid cancers has greatly improved, and this has permitted the development of novel therapeutic tools in patients with refractory disease. Kinase inhibitors inhibit kinases of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, and by doing this inhibit angiogenesis, and some of these agents also inhibit other kinases of the MAPkinase pathway. These inhibitors are effective in differentiated and medullary thyroid cancers, and induce a partial response or a long term stabilisation in more than half of patients.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Colon cancer closely follows the paradigm of a single ""gatekeeper gene."" Mutations inactivating the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene are found in approximately 80% of all human colon tumors and heterozygosity for such mutations produces an autosomal dominant colon cancer predisposition in humans and in murine models. However, this tight association between a single genotype and phenotype belies a complex association of genetic and epigenetic factors that together generate the broad phenotypic spectrum ofboth familial and sporadic colon cancers. In this Chapter, we give a general overview of the structure, function and outstanding issues concerning the role of Apc in human and experimental colon cancer. The availability of increasingly close models for human colon cancer in genetically tractable animal species enables the discovery and eventual molecular identification of genetic modifiers of the Apc-mutant phenotypes, connecting the central role of Apc in colon carcinogenesis to the myriad factors that ultimately determine the course of the disease.",Colon_Cancer
"Globally, thyroid cancer accounts for 2 % of all cancer diagnoses, and can be classified as well-differentiated or undifferentiated. Currently, differentiated thyroid carcinomas have good prognoses, and can be treated with a combination of therapies, including surgical thyroidectomy, radioactive iodine therapy and hormone-based therapy. On the other hand, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, a subtype of undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma characterized by the loss of thyroid-like phenotype and function, does not respond to either radioactive iodine or hormone therapies. In most cases, anaplastic thyroid carcinomas are diagnosed in later stages of the disease, deeming them inoperable, and showing poor response rates to systemic chemotherapy. Recently, treatment courses using multiple-target agents are being explored and clinical trials have shown very promising results, such as overall survival rates, progression-free survival and tumor shrinkage. This review is focused on thyroid carcinomas, with particular focus on anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, exploring its undifferentiated nature. Special interest will be given to the treatment approaches currently available and respective obstacles or drawbacks. Our purpose is to contribute to understand why this malignancy presents low responsiveness to current treatments, while overviewing novel therapies and clinical trials.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy with four major types distinguished on the basis of histopathological features: papillary, follicular, medullary, and anaplastic. Classification of thyroid cancer is the primary step in the assessment of prognosis and selection of the treatment. However, in some cases, cytological and histological patterns are inconclusive; hence, classification based on histopathology could be supported by molecular biomarkers, including markers identified with the use of high-throughput ""omics"" techniques. Beside genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, metabolomic approach emerges as the most downstream attitude reflecting phenotypic changes and alterations in pathophysiological states of biological systems. Metabolomics using mass spectrometry and magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques allows qualitative and quantitative profiling of small molecules present in biological systems. This approach can be applied to reveal metabolic differences between different types of thyroid cancer and to identify new potential candidates for molecular biomarkers. In this review, we consider current results concerning application of metabolomics in the field of thyroid cancer research. Recent studies show that metabolomics can provide significant information about the discrimination between different types of thyroid lesions. In the near future, one could expect a further progress in thyroid cancer metabolomics leading to development of molecular markers and improvement of the tumor types classification and diagnosis.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Cutaneous metastasis from lung cancer is rare, but physicians should understand its significance. We treated eight such patients during a 30-month period at Wilkes-Barre (Pa) General Hospital. The seven men and one woman ranged in age from 46 to 72 years (mean, 59 years). In three, the skin lesion was the first manifestation of the underlying cancer and in another three, it was found coincident with the lung mass. Pathologic findings included small-cell undifferentiated carcinoma in four patients, squamous cell carcinoma in three patients, and large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma in one patient. Seven of the eight primary lung lesions were in the upper lobes. Six patients had clinically occult visceral metastases at the time of skin biopsy. Only one patient survived more than six months following skin metastasis. Biopsy specimens must be taken from all new skin lesions, particularly in patients who smoke or who already have a history of lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer
"Since a high concentration of beta-carotene in blood reduces the risk of lung cancer, a large-scale intervention examination containing beta-carotene was conducted, mainly by the National Cancer Institute. The results showed that the risk of lung cancer increased with administration of beta-carotene. This result demonstrates that continuation of smoking is an important factor in the increased risk, and not smoking is confirmed to be the most important prevention method. The authors examined the treatment effect of raising the concentration of folic acid and vitamin B12 in blood on bronchial dysplasia as a pre-cancerous lesion. A significant medical treatment effect was see in the folic acid and vitamin B12 medication groups, which seems promising for the chemoprevention of lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer
"In the United States, lung cancer is the third most common cancer and the overall leading cause of cancer death. Due to advances in immunotherapy and targeted therapy, 5-year survival is increasing. The growing population of patients with lung cancer and cancer survivors highlights the importance of comprehensive cancer care, including recognizing and addressing financial toxicity. Financial toxicity is a term used to contextualize the negative effects of the costs of cancer treatment in terms of patient quality of life. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Value Framework places emphasis on high-value care as it evaluates cancer treatments ""based on clinical benefit, side effects, and improvements in patient symptoms or quality of life in the context of cost"". Prior studies have shown that risk factors for financial toxicity in patients with lung cancer include lower household income or savings, inability to afford basic necessities, higher than anticipated out of pocket expenses, and taking sick leave. Among lung cancer survivors, patients experience increased unemployment and lower wages compared to the general population underscoring the lasting effects of financial toxicity. Financial toxicity is associated with increased psychosocial distress and decreased quality of life, and bankruptcy is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with cancer. Despite the negative implications of financial toxicity on patients, standardized screening practices and evidence-based interventions are lacking. The ""COmphrensive Score for financial Toxicity (COST)"" tool has been validated for assessing financial toxicity with correlation with health-related quality of life. Further research is needed to understand the utility of incorporating routine screening for financial toxicity into clinical practice and the efficacy of interventions. Understanding the relationship between financial toxicity and quality of life and survival is critical to providing high-value cancer care and survivorship care.",Lung_Cancer
"Adjuvant therapy for colon cancer is now a mature and widely accepted standard of care for patients with resected large bowel tumors: adjuvant therapy for stage III colon cancer has also been shown to be highly cost-effective. The cost of 5-FU/levamisole therapy for stage III colon cancer per year of life saved is less than $ 5,000, which represents a favorable cost-benefit relationship for a medical intervention. The clinician managing a patient with colon cancer at the present time has several options for therapy. In patients with stage III colon cancer, therapy with 5-FU-based regimens clearly increases overall and disease-free survival. It is also clear that the results that have been obtained are not perfect; therefore, the first option of therapy should always be an ongoing clinical trial. Many such trials are available, and Table 7 lists currently active studies in the United States. The clinician managing a patient with stage III colon cancer who is not in a clinical trial may choose a variety of regimens administered for durations of 6 to 12 months (Table 8). The preponderance of evidence suggests that 5-FU plus levamisole for 12 months is equal in efficacy to 5-FU plus leucovorin-based regimens given for a shorter period of time. A clinician may still choose the 5-FU plus levamisole regimen because of the decreased oral, myelosuppressive, and diarrheal toxicities associated with that regimen as opposed to the 5-FU/leucovorin regimens. Portal vein infusion of fluorinated pyrimidines still must be considered investigational. Finally, although we cannot be absolutely sure about the benefit of adjuvant therapy in patients with resected node-negative colon cancer, the NSABP data suggest that some benefit may be seen in these patients. It is known that patients with stage II cancers demonstrating high-grade bowel obstruction or bowel perforation have poor prognoses with surgery alone. Such patients may be good candidates for adjuvant therapy. Also, a major effort to define high risk and low risk for recurrence in patients with stage II colon cancer by analyzing molecular genetic factors (tumor ploidy and alternations in tumor suppressor genes) may lead to a selection of Dukes B patients definitely requiring adjuvant therapy.",Colon_Cancer

"Deep learning is beginning to impact biological research and biomedical applications as a result of its ability to integrate vast datasets, learn arbitrarily complex relationships and incorporate existing knowledge. Already, deep learning models can predict, with varying degrees of success, how genetic variation alters cellular processes involved in pathogenesis, which small molecules will modulate the activity of therapeutically relevant proteins, and whether radiographic images are indicative of disease. However, the flexibility of deep learning creates new challenges in guaranteeing the performance of deployed systems and in establishing trust with stakeholders, clinicians and regulators, who require a rationale for decision making. We argue that these challenges will be overcome using the same flexibility that created them; for example, by training deep models so that they can output a rationale for their predictions. Significant research in this direction will be needed to realize the full potential of deep learning in biomedicine.",Generic
"The large clinical studies of lung cancer screening carried out more than 20 years ago were interpreted as evidence against screening. Those studies have been recently reassessed in the light of methodologic flaws in the randomization of subjects at risk for lung cancer. There is no evidence to support the former conclusion that screening is ineffective and the consequent official recommendation not to screen for lung cancer. The hypothesis of overdiagnosis of lung cancers diagnosed by screening is false. Clinical evidence supports the concept that the current dogma against screening for lung cancer is untrue. Indeed, the 5-year survival rate of patients with NSCLC detected in stage I and radically resected ranges from 60% to 80%. This rate is in sharp contrast to the 10% survival rate of stage I NSCLC not resected. About 90% of lung cancer cases are detected among smokers and former smokers; these well-known at-risk subjects should be offered a screening test with the goal of detecting the disease when it is in stage I. It is expected that the techniques for early detection of lung cancer will be refined and become more sensitive in the near future, so that it will be possible to detect an increasingly large proportion of lung cancers when they are truly in stage I (i.e., nonmetastatic) and curable by radical surgical resection. Low-dose helical CT scan is currently believed to represent a very useful technique for screening for lung cancer, with a higher sensitivity than chest radiograph screening. Chest radiography for lung cancer screening, however, is cheaper and ubiquitously available, and it should still be recommended if CT scan is locally unavailable. As underscored in a recent commentary in The Lancet, the existing public health policy discouraging the screening for lung cancer is in urgent need of reconsideration.",Lung_Cancer
"Historically, all non-small cell lung cancers were essentially grouped together and considered to be a single disease.

"Deep learning (DL) is a relatively newer subdomain of machine learning (ML) with incredible potential for certain applications in the medical field. Given recent advances in its use in neuro-oncology, its role in diagnosing, prognosticating, and managing the care of cancer patients has been the subject of many research studies. The gamut of studies has shown that the landscape of algorithmic methods is constantly improving with each iteration from its inception. With the increase in the availability of high-quality data, more training sets will allow for higher fidelity models. However, logistical and ethical concerns over a prospective trial comparing prognostic abilities of DL and physicians severely limit the ability of this technology to be widely adopted. One of the medical tenets is judgment, a facet of medical decision making in DL that is often missing because of its inherent nature as a ""black box."" A natural distrust for newer technology, combined with a lack of autonomy that is normally expected in our current medical practices, is just one of several important limitations in implementation. In our review, we will first define and outline the different types of artificial intelligence (AI) as well as the role of AI in the current advances of clinical medicine. We briefly highlight several of the salient studies using different methods of DL in the realm of neuroradiology and summarize the key findings and challenges faced when using this nascent technology, particularly ethical challenges that could be faced by users of DL.",Generic
"Radiotherapy is the most common nonsurgical treatment for patients with lung cancer. Its value in controlling specific cancer related symptoms is undisputed and can be achieved with unsophisticated and undemanding schedules. However, these treatment regimens cannot be expected to produce durable local control or significant impact on survival. Their use cannot be generally accepted for all inoperable patients. The use of high-dose radiotherapy with curative intent has been brought into disrepute by often inappropriate patient selection and subsequently poor results. In a number of small pilot studies, survival comparable to surgical series can be achieved in operable patients. Safe delivery of high-dose radiotherapy to intrathoracic tumours represents a formidable technical challenge. The sophisticated treatment planning which is necessary and consistent diagnostic evaluation is often lacking in practice when the value of local therapy is perceived as minimal. Recent developments in radiation technology, tumour biology and understanding of normal tissue responses bring an opportunity to design new and more effective treatment schedules. New developments in systemic therapy far from making thoracic irradiation obsolete, demand higher rates of durable local control. The interrelationships between toxicities to normal tissues and potential advantage in antitumour activity bring further challenges in design of optimal combined modality schedules. The challenge facing the Radiation Oncologist interested in thoracic malignancies is how to balance the multiple and often conflicting possibilities and formulate novel schedules that can be evaluated in practice. A further challenge is how to facilitate the introduction of these resource-intensive strategies into the real world of shrinking resources and increasing waiting lists. The potential gains may be individually small but with the numerical importance of lung cancer may have a global impact.",Lung_Cancer

A diet rich in fruit and vegetables reduces the incidence of lung cancer by approximately 25%. The reduction is of the same magnitude in current smokers, ex-smokers and in persons who have never smoked. Vitamin A, C and E supplements and beta-carotene offer no protection against the development of lung cancer.

Although surgery will likely remain the mainstay of definitive treatment for the majority of colorectal malignancies, a better understanding of tumor progression and biology will help guide the choice of surgical therapy to best achieve a curative resection.

Although TNM staging remains our strongest tool at this point for establishing prognosis and directing therapy, expansion of our knowledge of the molecular events underlying colorectal tumorigenesis undoubtedly will lead to the refinement of our current staging and prognostic systems.",Colon_Cancer
"The surgeon is one of the most important prognostic factors for patients with colon cancer. Depending on the site of the primary tumour, the potential lymphatic spread is uni-, bi- or tridirectional. Therefore, the extent of surgical resection depends on the site of the tumour and the patient's vascular anatomy. A minimum resection of 10 cm of grossly normal bowel on both sides of the tumour is required to keep the risk of unremoved paracolic lymph node metastasis below 5%. A central ligature of main colic artery (arteries) is strongly recommended, as central lymph nodes are involved in more than 10%. The no-touch isolation technique is easily and quickly performed and has been shown to provide a survival benefit of 6% compared to the conventional technique. Adherent or infiltrated adjacent organs should never be separated from the tumour because the tumour perforation and consecutive tumour cell spillage is afflicted with a reduction in 5-year survival expectancy of up to 40 %. Prophylactic oophorectomy seems to be of no survival benefit, only infiltrated or grossly abnormal ovaries have to be removed. Sentinel lymph node biopsy facilitates an accurate nodal staging and may result in an up-staging in 15-30% and in necessitating adjuvant chemotherapy.

"Thyroid cancer is the most common neoplasia of the endocrine system and accounts for approximately 1% of all newly diagnosed cancer cases. Its incidence has rapidly grown over the past few decades. Although most thyroid carcinomas are of the well-differentiated papillary histology, and respond well to treatment with surgical resection followed by radioactive iodine ablation, tumors with more aggressive phenotype, such as follicular, poorly differentiated, anaplastic, and medullary cancers, lead to almost 1500 patient deaths annually. Therefore, understanding molecular mechanisms that regulate the biology of these carcinomas could be helpful to identify new molecules acting as novel targets for therapeutic intervention. NF-kappaB has been recently shown to play an important role in thyroid cancer for its ability to control the proliferative and the anti-apoptotic signaling pathways of thyroid neoplastic cells. Oncogenic proteins RET/PTC, RAS and BRAF, that are involved in many aspects of thyroid carcinogenesis, can induce NF-kappaB activation in papillary, follicular, and medullary thyroid carcinomas, while constitutive de-regulated NF-kappaB activity has been found in anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. A number of NF-kappaB inhibitors have been demonstrated to induce anti-proliferative effects and/or massive apoptosis, especially in combination with radio- or chemo-therapy. The results obtained suggest that targeting NF-kappaB could be a promising strategy for advanced thyroid cancer treatment.",Thyroid_Cancer

"With one million new cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosed annually in the world, CRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the Western world. Patients with stage I-III CRC can be cured with surgery but are at risk for recurrence. Colorectal cancer is characterized by the presence of chromosomal deletions and gains. Large genomic profiling studies have however not been conducted in this disease. The number of a specific genetic aberration in a tumour sample could correlate with recurrence-free survival or overall survival, possibly leading to its use as biomarker for therapeutic decisions. At this point there are not sufficient markers for prediction of disease recurrence in colorectal cancer, which can be used in the clinic to discriminate between stage II patients who will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. For instance, the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy has been most clearly demonstrated in stage III disease with an approximately 30 percent relative reduction in the risk of disease recurrence. The benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II disease are less certain, the risk for relapse is much smaller in the overall group and the specific patients at risk are hard to identify.",Colon_Cancer
"The staging and the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer are in constant evolution. Positron emission tomography has modified the diagnostic work-up and the initial evaluation of the tumoural extension, mainly for locoregional disease when a treatment with curative intent is available.

This new international classification will be implemented in 2010. The therapeutic approach of non metastatic non-small cell lung cancer has also considerably evolved. In resectable stage II and III diseases, cisplatin-based chemotherapy adjuvant to surgery allows a significant survival improvement while concomitant administration of chemo-radiotherapy demonstrated its superiority on a sequential treatment of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy in locoregional unresectable but irradiable neoplasms. Above conventional chemotherapy, some ""targeted"" therapies have shown their efficacy in selected populations. Current researches in lung cancer are now dedicated to the search of factors able to predict the sensitivity to chemotherapy, allowing a better selection of the patients susceptible to benefit from this treatment and avoiding the administration of ineffective, expensive and toxic therapies.",Lung_Cancer

"Primary lung cancer is now the most frequent cancer in the world. Tobacco smoking still represents its predominant cause: a recent estimate attributes 80-85% of lung cancers to smoking and the epidemic of lung cancer mortality is still ongoing, with a major contribution from East European and developing countries. The study of smoking in association with lung cancer has contributed to the understanding of the carcinogenic process in humans, especially since molecular epidemiology techniques have been developed. However, the most probable carcinogenic model, still needs to be more clearly established. Presently, it can be summarised that smoking cessation is beneficial at any age, and more so when early. The contribution of passive smoking to lung cancer risk has been widely documented; its effect in terms of attributable number of cases, however, is not easily estimated at a population level. Some authors suggest that non-smoking-related lung cancer frequency is increasing over time. Exposure to environmental carcinogens with a major emphasis on those deriving from industrial processes, among which asbestos, and on air pollution due to traffic in urban areas has been advocated. Finally, a special interest has grown in the last years on possible protective factors for lung cancer, mainly diet-related (high intake of fresh fruits and vegetables), but results from the first large randomised chemoprevention trial based on alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene treatment, dealt with ""paradoxical"" results.",Lung_Cancer
"Heart disease and cancer, the major causes of mortality and morbidity in Western countries, have common risk factors. Exercise appears to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, but its role with respect to primary prevention of cancer has not been emphasized. Here we evaluate the epidemiological studies dealing with exercise and colon cancer. Despite the fact that different methods of assessing the amount of typical exercise of individuals and the different types of physical activity measured (occupational and recreational), there is remarkably consistent evidence that people who are highly physically active could be at a reduced risk of cancer of the colon. An analysis of case-control and cohort studies suggests that exercise might reduce the risk, at least in men, by up to one-third. We conclude that exercise has been overlooked as a potentially useful, effective, and acceptable method for reducing the risk of colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Cancer gender disparity in incidence, disease aggressiveness and prognosis has been observed in a variety of cancers. Thyroid cancer is one of the fastest growing cancer diagnoses worldwide. It is 2.9-times more common in women than men. The less aggressive histologic subtypes of thyroid cancer are more common in women, whereas the more aggressive histologic subtypes have similar gender distribution. The gender disparity in incidence, aggressiveness and prognosis is well established for thyroid cancer but the cause of the disparity is poorly understood. The aim of this article is to evaluate the current evidence on the cause of thyroid cancer gender disparity. Dietary and environmental factors do not appear to have a significant role in thyroid cancer gender disparity. Common somatic mutations in BRAF, rearranged in transformation/papillary thyroid carcinomas (RET/PTC) and neurotrophin receptor-tyrosine kinase (NTRK) also do not account for the gender disparity in thyroid cancer. While reproductive factors would seem a logical hypothesis to account for the gender disparity, there appears to be no conclusive effect on the risk of developing thyroid cancer. Recent studies on estrogen receptor status in thyroid cancer show a difference in the receptor subtypes expressed based on the histology of thyroid cancer. Moreover, the response to estrogen is dependent on the specific estrogen receptor expressed in thyroid cancer cells. However, what determines the tumor-specific sex hormone receptor expression is unclear. No established molecular factors appear to explain gender differences in thyroid cancer. Therefore, the application of high-throughput genomic and proteomic approaches to the study of thyroid cancer gender disparity could be helpful for better understanding the molecular basis for gender differences in thyroid and other cancers.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Chemoprevention is defined as the use of specific natural or pharmacologic agents to reverse, suppress, or prevent the carcinogenic process to the development of invasive cancer. The basic idea behind lung cancer chemoprevention is the concept that diffuse injury of the respiratory epithelium results from chronic carcinogen exposure. The rationale for chemoprevention arose from epidemiologic data demonstrating the existence of dietary inhibitors of carcinogenesis, basic studies of epithelial carcinogenesis, and laboratory evidence from animal models. Many of the studies evaluating specific agents focused on vitamin A and its synthetic analogs, the retinoids. Chemoprevention trials have investigated the effect of retinoids and other agents on bronchial metaplasia and dysplasia and sputum atypia; many of these trials have reported conflicting results. Several ongoing multi-institutional trials are evaluating chemoprevention regimens for prevention of second primary aerodigestive tract cancers, the results of which are eagerly awaited. Primary prevention trials to prevent lung cancer have reported sobering results, which negate the protective effects of beta-carotene against lung cancer development and provide no justification for consuming supplemental beta-carotene for cancer chemoprevention. In the future, the use of biomolecular markers as intermediate end points in chemoprevention trials may reduce the cost and time commitment required for these trials and aid in selecting a patient population that would benefit most from chemopreventive intervention or approaches such as gene therapy.",Lung_Cancer

"We report the results of a multicentre retrospective chart review of 2214 patients with thyroid cancer registered at 13 radiotherapy centres between 1958 and 1978. The data analysed included sex, age at the time of diagnosis, pathological diagnosis, extent of disease before treatment, types of treatment and their complications, and the rates of recurrence and survival up to 24 years after diagnosis. Although papillary cancers were most common, anaplastic and miscellaneous tumours were more frequent than expected, which reflects the type of patients referred by endocrinologists and surgeons to radiotherapy centres. There were marked differences in patterns of referral to the centres. Some patients with papillary and follicular thyroid cancers died of these cancers up to 20 years after diagnosis. The clinical manifestations, treatment and outcome of the rarer types of thyroid malignant tumours were of particular interest. The influence of age at the time of diagnosis on survival rates for patients with papillary or follicular thyroid cancer was highly significant, indicating much more aggressive behaviour of these cancers in older patients, particularly those beyond the age of 60 years. A more detailed analysis of tumour subtypes should provide new information on their natural history and lead to better management.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Patient with goiter usually has benign disease. While investigation is important, clinical factors weight heavily in the diagnosis of cancer. Aside from serum calcitonin and CEA, biochemical findings are of little help. Radioisotope scanning is of fundamental importance and has an implication in history. Ultrasonography has a diminishing role although its use has led to the widespread acceptance of needle aspiration. Needle aspiration cytology is now the most important maneuver in preoperative assessment and management of the goiter patient. Its results permit refined operative selection, the institution of safe conservative management, and greater organization in surgical treatment. Persistent cooperation between clinician and pathologist can yield a high rate of the reliable preoperative cytological diagnosis obtained by needle aspiration.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The biology of colorectal cancer provides a unique opportunity for early detection and prevention. There is now evidence that screening of asymptomatic average-risk individuals over 50 years of age can reduce mortality resulting from colorectal cancer.

The cost of screening is an important issue in the development of public policy. This review discusses the various screening options, examines the ""downstream"" effects of screening, and reviews the anticipated costs and effectiveness. Ultimately, the effectiveness of any screening program depends on patient compliance. Further research is needed to determine the best methods of enhancing patient adherence to a screening program.",Colon_Cancer
"Accurate tumor staging is essential for choosing the appropriate treatment strategy in patients with lung cancer. It has already been shown that FDG-PET is highly accurate in classifying lung nodules as benign or malignant. Integrated PET-CT enables the exact matching of focal abnormalities on PET to anatomic structures on CT. PET-CT is superior in diagnostic accuracy for T staging and differentiation between tumor and peritumoral atelectasis. PET has also proved to be a very effective staging modality for mediastinal nodal staging. It has been demonstrated to assist mediastinoscopy to reveal additional mediastinal disease in 6% of patients. PET detects unexpected extrathoracic metastases in 10-20% of patients and changes therapeutic management in about 20% of patients. A very high accuracy of FDG-PET in distinguishing recurrent disease from benign treatment effects has been shown. Patients should be evaluated after a minimum of 2 months after completion of therapy. FDG-PET can be clinically used for selecting biopsy sites. At our institution PET-CT has become the standard imaging modality for staging patients with lung cancer. Although not all tumors take up FDG, other radiotracers are being studied to expand the utility of PET-CT. PET-CT offers many opportunities for the patients, the clinicians, and the researchers. PET-CT has the potential to become the most efficient oncologic examination in the near future.",Lung_Cancer
"Calcitriol, 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25 (OH)2D3), the most active form of vitamin D, is a pleotropic hormone with a wide range of biological activities. Due to its ability to regulate calcium and phosphate metabolism, 1,25D3 plays a major role in bone health. In addition, 1,25D3 binds to the vitamin D receptor and thereby regulates the expression of a number of genes which control growth, differentiation and survival of cancer cells. In agreement, the levels of vitamin D3 appear to be an essential determinant for the development and progression of colon cancer and supplementation with vitamin D3 is effective in suppressing intestinal tumorigenesis in animal models. Vitamin D3 has been estimated to lower the incidence of colorectal cancer by 50%, which is consistent with the inverse correlation between dietary vitamin D3 intake or sunlight exposure and human colorectal cancer. Several studies confirmed that increasing vitamin D3 lowers colon cancer incidence, reduces polyp recurrence, and that sufficient levels of vitamin D3 are associated with better overall survival of colon cancer patients. Vitamin D regulates the homeostasis of intestinal epithelium by modulating the oncogenic Wnt signaling pathway and by inhibiting tumor-promoting inflammation. Both activities contribute to the ability of 1,25D3 to prevent the development and progression of colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Mouse models of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been crucial in the identification of the role of genes responsible for the full range of pathology of the human disease and have proved to be dependable for testing anti-cancer drugs. Recent research points toward the relevance of tumor, angiogenic, and immune microenvironments in CRC progression to late-stage disease, as well as the treatment of it. This study examines important mouse models in CRC, discussing inherent strengths and weaknesses disclosed during their construction. It endeavors to provide both a synopsis of previous work covering how investigators have defined various models and to evaluate critically how researchers are most likely to use them in the future. Accumulated evidence regarding the metastatic process and the hope of using checkpoint inhibitors and immunological inhibitor therapies points to the need for a genetically engineered mouse model that is both immunocompetent and autochthonous.",Colon_Cancer
"Inhibition of specific processes essential for tumour vascular development is actually one of the key strategies for treatment of lung cancer, for which angiogenesis is consistently predictive of a poor prognosis. The most promising agents target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, either by preventing VEGF-receptor binding as bevacizumab or inhibiting downstream receptor signaling in endothelial cells. Combination of bevacizumab with standard first-line chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer demonstrates a significant survival advantage comparing to chemotherapy alone, which provides the ""proof of concept"" for inhibition of angiogenesis in lung cancer. Development of small molecules inhibiting tyrosine kinase activity of VEGF-receptors is ongoing; many of them showed a single-agent activity but their most likely use will be in combination with chemotherapy or biological agents. Toxicity issues are of concern with the occurrence of fatal pulmonary hemorrhage after cavitation and necrosis of primary tumour, which requires appropriate selection of patients before treatment. A better understanding of the complex process of angiogenesis and of surrogate markers of treatment effect will improve our ability to design more effective therapies.",Lung_Cancer
"Households are becoming increasingly heterogeneous. While previous studies have revealed many important insights (e.g., wealth effect, income effect), they could only incorporate two or three variables at a time. However, in order to have a more detailed understanding of complex household heterogeneity, more variables should be considered simultaneously. In this study, we argue that advanced clustering techniques can be useful for investigating high-dimensional household heterogeneity. A deep learning-based clustering method is used to effectively handle the high-dimensional balance sheet data of approximately 50,000 households. The employment of appropriate dimension-reduction techniques is the key to incorporate the full joint distribution of high-dimensional data in the clustering step. Our study suggests that various variables should be used together to explain household heterogeneity. Asset variables are found to be crucial for understanding heterogeneity within wealthy households, while debt variables are more important for those households that are not wealthy. In addition, relationships with sociodemographic variables (e.g., age, education, and family size) were further analyzed. Although clusters are found only based on financial variables, they are shown to be closely related to most sociodemographic variables.",Generic
"Radioiodine therapy is indicated in patients after total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer, either as ablation of remnant thyroid tissue or to treat distant metastasis, most commonly to lung and bone. Surveillance after treatment includes thyroglobulin measurement, neck ultrasonography, chest CT, scintigraphy with radiothallium or diagnostic dose radioiodine, and possibly FDG-PET. Minor but frequent side effects involve organs with physiological iodine uptake, namely the salivary glands and stomach. Uncommon but serious ones are aggravation of spinal paralysis in cases with large vertebral metastasis and myelosuppression in those with extensive skeletal lesions. Despite clear therapeutic effects in some subjects, proving prolonged survival with this therapy in the group of patients with known metastasis as a whole is an elusive goal due to too good prognosis. One the other hand, a prospective analysis of a large case series did show beneficial effect of the radio-ablation. Empirical treatment is still debatable in subjects with elevated serum thyroglobulin level and negative whole body radioiodine scan. In the near future recombinant human TSH will obviate the need for intentional hypothyroidism in preparation for diagnostic scan and therapy with radioiodine.",Thyroid_Cancer

"TGFbeta and activin are members of the TGFbeta superfamily and play a wide role in development, proliferation and apoptosis. These growth factors exert their biological effects by binding to the type I and II membrane receptors to transduce their signalling through the nucleus by phosphorylation of R-SMADs (SMAD 2/3) and co-SMADs (Smad 4). The proper control of TGFbeta/activin pathway is negatively regulated by inhibitory SMAD (SMAD7) and by E3 ubiquitination enzymes (Smurfs). Physiologically, TGFbeta and activin act as potent growth inhibitors in thyroid follicular cell. Thus, alterations in the receptors and components of SMAD signalling pathway are associated with several types of tumors. Since TGFbeta and activin generate their intracellular signalling through the same components of the SMAD pathway, the unbalance of this pathway impairs both of anti-mitogenic signals in the cell. This review addresses aspects of the molecular mechanisms in the understanding of resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of TGFbeta and activin due to the disequilibrium in the SMAD inhibitory pathway in thyroid neoplasia.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Thyroid cancer is comparatively rare. Thyroid nodules, on the other hand, are frequently diagnosed as a result of increasing use of diagnostic imaging. Cytological investigation of small nodules that have been found by chance often reveals micropapillary carcinoma that is probably not clinically relevant. The new guideline 'Thyroid cancer' advises that cytological investigation of these non-palpable, incidentally discovered thyroid nodules should only be performed on indication. The standard treatment for patients with papillary or follicular thyroid cancer consists of thyroidectomy followed by, if indicated, lymph-node dissection, ablation therapy with radioactive iodine and TSH-suppression. The extent of this treatment is determined on the basis of known prognostic factors and the results of initial treatment. Targeted systemic therapy is available for patients with metastatic progressive disease.

"The results of the many clinical trials published in 1997 had only modest impact on the treatment results using either cytostatic agents alone or combined with radiotherapy in lung cancer. In SCLC, combination chemotherapy including platin-compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin) and the podophyllotoxins (etoposide and teniposide) continue to be the cornerstone of therapy. Complete plus partial responses to combination chemotherapy occurs in 80-90% of all patients. Median survival is at present 11-17 months, and overall 5-year survival approximately 5% depending on the initial tumor stage. The duration of treatment has been shortened to 5-6 months. In relapsing patients topotecan and paclitaxel appear to have clinical useful activity. For epidermoid, adeno- and large cell carcinoma further support has arisen for the use of preoperative and preirradiatory chemotherapy in stage III NSCLC, but further studies are needed before specific recommendations can be given for general use. For patients with advanced NSCLC, new innovative treatments are still urgently needed. Platin-containing regimens with the inclusion of new agents, such as gemcitabine, taxenes, and navelbine, yielded response rates of 42-55% in phase II trials, but results from large phase III trials are necessary in order to measure the impact of these new agents in the management of NSCLC.

In patients with non-small-cell cancer, surgical resection offers substantial cure rates in early-stage cases. Combined chemotherapy plus radiation therapy has clearly improved the treatment results for patients with locally advanced cancers, and patients with metastatic disease are now candidates for newer chemotherapy regimens with more favourable results than in the past.

"Over the last 50 years, the incidence of human thyroid cancer disease has seen a significative increment. This comes along with an even higher increment of surgery, since, according to the international guidelines, patients are sometimes addressed to surgery also when the fine needle aspiration gives undetermined cytological diagnosis. As a matter of fact, only 30% of the thyroid glands removed for diagnostic purpose have a post surgical histological report of malignancy: this implies that about 70% of the patients have suffered an unnecessary thyroid removal. Here we show that Raman spectroscopy investigation of thyroid tissues provides reliable cancer diagnosis. Healthy tissues are consistently distinguished from cancerous ones with an accuracy of [Formula: see text] 90%, and the three cancer typology with highest incidence are clearly identified.

"The complete response rate in advanced non-small cell lung cancer is extremely low and the effect of chemotherapy on survival is still obscure. The emergence of resistance to anticancer agents results in the poor prognosis in small cell lung cancer although the initial response rate has improved. The significance of chemosensitivity test in lung cancer can be classified to three areas. The first of these as the individualization of chemotherapy, which means the selection of different active drugs for individual patients. In spite of numerous studies, there remain many theoretical and technical problems in predictive drug sensitivity testing. It is still far from practical use. Secondly, drug sensitivity tests have contributed to the screening of new anticancer agents. Since 1986, NCI (USA) started the disease oriented drug screening system (DOS) using human cancer cell lines. So far, active drugs against drug resistant tumors such as colon and non-small cell carcinoma have been found out by DOS. The clinical application of these drugs selected by DOS may give the answer concerning the validity of this new screening system. Thirdly, drug sensitivity tests have widely been used for the analysis of the mechanisms of drug sensitivity and resistance.

"Evidence has now accumulated that colonoscopy and removal of polyps, especially during screening and surveillance programs, is effective in overall risk reduction for colon cancer. After resection of malignant pedunculated colon polyps or early stage colon cancers, long-term repeated surveillance programs can also lead to detection and removal of asymptomatic high risk advanced adenomas and new early stage metachronous cancers. Early stage colon cancer can be defined as disease that appears to have been completely resected with no subsequent evidence of involvement of adjacent organs, lymph nodes or distant sites. This differs from the clinical setting of an apparent ""curative"" resection later pathologically upstaged following detection of malignant cells extending into adjacent organs, peritoneum, lymph nodes or other distant sites, including liver. This highly selected early stage colon cancer group remains at high risk for subsequent colon polyps and metachronous colon cancer. Precise staging is important, not only for assessing the need for adjuvant chemotherapy, but also for patient selection for continued surveillance. With advanced stages of colon cancer and a more guarded outlook, repeated surveillance should be limited. In future, novel imaging technologies (e.g., confocal endomicroscopy), coupled with increased pathological recognition of high risk markers for lymph node involvement (e.g., ""tumor budding"") should lead to improved staging and clinical care.",Colon_Cancer

"The role of limited lung resection 'segmentectomy and wedge resection' in the treatment of lung cancer has been reviewed. Survival for patients with stage I lung cancer and lesions less than 2 cm is comparable to that of major resections such as lobectomy. The theoretical advantage of limited resection is the simplicity of the procedure and the potential for performing it through lesser invasive techniques. The major drawback at this time which should render it a compromise rather than a choice operation is the increased risk of locoregional recurrence. Until properly conducted clinical trials validate its efficacy in peripheral T1 lung cancer with or without adjuvent therapy, sublobar resection should be limited to patients that are at poor risk of tolerating major lung resection. Sublobar resections however may also play a useful role in treatment of metachronous or synchronous lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer

"Background: Little is known about financial hardship among Hispanic women with thyroid cancer. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of financial hardship and to identify correlates of financial hardship in this understudied patient group. Methods: We surveyed Hispanic women who had diagnoses of thyroid cancer reported to the Los Angeles Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry in 2014-2015, and who had previously completed our thyroid cancer survey in 2017-2018 (N = 273; 80% response rate). Acculturation was assessed with the Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanics (SASH). Patients were asked about three outcome measures since their thyroid cancer diagnosis: (i) financial status, (ii) insurance status, and (iii) material measures of financial hardship, collapsed into a single composite measure of financial hardship. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify correlates of financial hardship. Results: Patients' median age at diagnosis was 47 years (range 20-79 years); 49% were low-acculturated and 47% reported financial hardship. Since their thyroid cancer diagnosis, 31% and 12% of the cohort reported being worse off regarding financial and insurance status, respectively. In multivariable analysis, high-acculturated older women were less likely to experience financial hardship compared with high-acculturated 20-year-old women. While financial hardship decreased with age for high-acculturated women (p = 0.002), financial hardship remained elevated across all age groups for low-acculturated women (p = 0.54). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that across all age groups, low-acculturated Hispanic women with thyroid cancer are vulnerable to financial hardship, emphasizing the need for tailored patient-focused interventions.",Thyroid_Cancer

"The terms ""hereditary,"" ""sporadic,"" and ""familial"" colorectal cancer (CRC) suggest a knowledge of causation; however, current understanding of CRC does not permit categorization of differing CRC risks in accord with their cause per se. Despite these serious shortcomings, these terms are defined operationally on the basis of a family history of cancer, and when available, additional phenotypic information. The sporadic type occurs in the absence of a family history of CRC in a first-degree relative. The familial type occurs when at least one first-degree relative has CRC. Both these categories require the exclusion of hereditary CRC. In the case of hereditary CRC, this type is defined as a family history of CRC occurring in a pattern that indicates autosomal-dominant inheritance, which also may involve certain phenotypic signs (depending on the specific disorder, i.e., florid adenomatous polyps, benign and malignant extracolonic lesions, cancer of unusually early onset, and multiple primary cancer, particularly synchronous and metachronous CRC). Although this operational classification does not produce etiologically homogeneous groups, it is believed to have pragmatic utility with respect to planning targeted surveillance and management strategies. Because of the distinctive natural history of CRC in hereditary syndromes, it is of paramount clinical importance to identify hereditary CRC when it does occur. Even in patients with no evidence of hereditary CRC syndrome, their family history may be second only to age in determining the best CRC screening program for those who are asymptomatic. In an attempt to provide a perspective on the clinical evaluation of CRC risk, research was reviewed on pathologic features and biomarkers that may be related to CRC causes, especially the genetic basis of CRC susceptibility.

Currently, information is lacking on the role of CD82 and CD63 during thyroid carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine whether the expression of CD82 and CD63 is a useful prognostic indicator in patients with thyroid carcinoma. The expression of CD82 and CD63 was analysed by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry in benign goiter (n=12) and 75 primary thyroid carcinoma tissue specimens (PTC: 33, FTC: 24, UTC: 18) out of which 36 were non-metastasized primary tumors and 39 were metastasized tumors (regional lymph node and/or distant metastases). All of the benign goiter tissues showed CD82 expression. By contrast, a significant decrease in CD82 mRNA and protein levels was detected in carcinoma tissues as compared to benign goiter tissues (p<0.001). A similar down-regulation was observed in metastasized tumor tissues when compared with non-metastasized tumors (all p<0.05). CD82 expression was correlated with pTNM status of differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid tumor and the pathologic stage of differentiated thyroid tumor. In contrast to CD82, CD63 mRNA and protein expression was unchanged in all thyroid carcinomas. Benign goiter tissues showed weak expression of CD63. There were no significant correlation between CD63 mRNA/protein expression and any clinical/pathological parameters. Our results support the hypothesis that down-regulation of CD82 expression may reflect an increased in vivo metastatic potential of thyroid cancer cells. CD82 may serve as a prognostic marker of metastasis in thyroid cancer. Constitutive expression of CD63 may indicate that this factor does not play a direct role in thyroid carcinogenesis.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Chemoprevention studies utilizing calcium have now progressed from basic measurements to clinical trials. Calcium's effects on epithelial cells have demonstrated decreased proliferation and induced cell differentiation with increasing levels of calcium in vitro, similar in vivo effects in rodent and human colon, and decreased carcinogen-induced colonic tumor formation in rodents. Current studies are attempting to inhibit colonic adenoma formation in human subjects. Most but not all epidemiologic studies also link increased dietary calcium with a decreased risk of colon cancer. In animal models, supplemental dietary calcium has decreased mammary epithelial cell hyperplasia and hyperproliferation and colonic cell hyperproliferation when the latter was induced by bile acids, fatty acids, and partial resection of the small intestine. Supplemental dietary calcium also decreased carcinogen-induced colonic tumors in several rodent models. In normal mice, and in mice carrying a targeted apc gene mutation, we recently increased colonic polypoid hyperplasias by a Western-style diet containing low calcium and vitamin D. In human subjects at increased risk for colon cancer, oral calcium supplementation significantly reduced colonic epithelial cell proliferation in most of the studies, including four randomized clinical trials. These studies have now progressed to short-term human clinical trials, including trials that measure the regrowth of transformed adenoma cells. Short-term adenoma-regrowth clinical trials, however, are limited in their ability to measure whether chemopreventive agents inhibit early genotoxic events, abnormal cellular metabolic activities involved in tumor promotion over many years, or the progression of adenoma cells to carcinoma.",Colon_Cancer
"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women, with 80% to 90% of cases caused by smoking. Small cell lung cancer accounts for 20% of all cases, and is usually treated with chemotherapy. Adenocarcinoma is the main non-small cell pathology, and is treated initially with surgery.",Lung_Cancer
"In order to maintain the QOL in lung cancer patients and also save on medical costs, chemotherapy should be performed on an outpatient basis as much as possible. If the performance status is good and their residence is nearby, then not only in the case of small cell lung cancer or unresectable non-small cell lung cancer, but also including postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer, in all such suitable cases, chemotherapy can be performed on an outpatient basis. For example, by performing outpatient chemotherapy in moderate amounts for older people, the survival can be improved while maintaining the QOL. However,a single dose of cisplatin 60 to 80 mg/m(2) requires a high volume iv infusion, and the first chemotherapy treatment needs to be carried out in the hospital for nausea and vomiting control. For a regimen of combined anticancer drugs other than cisplatin and including carboplatin, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, irinotecan, gemcitabine or vinorelbine, the required iv time is short, side effects such as nausea or vomiting are less severe,and it is easily performed on an outpatient basis. An oral anticancer drug, gefitinib, or S-1 can also be an effective choice for non-small cell lung cancer. Since lung cancer patients tend to be susceptible to obstructive pneumonia or pneumonia from opportunistic infections, these need particular attention at the time of neutropenia. In addition, strict caution is required in order to prevent prescription or medication errors, or medical accidents such as leakage of the intravenous drip. If severe side effects occur, then a system must be prepared in which the patient can make contact promptly in emergency situations and thus can be hospitalized as necessary. Outpatient chemotherapy for lung cancers is increasing in Japan, however, there are many issues including insufficient staff, overworked staff, or situations where home nursing care places a heavy burden on the family. The assignment of sufficient medical treatment fees, the rationalization of work responsibilities or further development of home assistance systems are therefore eagerly anticipated.",Lung_Cancer
"Association between autoimmune thyroiditis (CLT) and thyroid cancer remains not clear. Although both diseases often occur simultaneously in histological samples, it is not yet clear whether CLT can be regarded as a risk factor for thyroid malignancy. This review focus on the known epidemiological and molecular genetics links between both diseases. Most studies have shown a significant association between thyroid cancer and positive antibodies to thyroglobulin and histological evidence of CLT, as well. Both disorders share some risk factors (greater incidence in women, in areas with adequate supply of iodine and in patients after radiotherapy of the neck) and molecular genetics linkage. For example: RET/PTC rearrangements could be more often found in carcinomas associated with CLT, but this mutation could be found in benign lesions such as CLT, as well. CLT seems to be a positive prognostic factor in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. It is associated with less invasive forms of tumor, lower occurrence of infiltrated lymphatic nodes and a lower risk of recurrence.",Thyroid_Cancer
"A review was undertaken of the clinical, gross, and microscopic features of thyroid carcinoma in all patients younger than 21 years of age seen at North Carolina Memorial Hospital from 1952 to 1987 (N = 32). These patients had papillary carcinoma, well-differentiated follicular carcinoma with H rthle cell change, medullary carcinoma, and an unclassifiable aggressive malignancy. In spite of the presence of lymph node metastases at diagnosis in more half the patients with papillary carcinoma, the prognosis of pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma appears to be excellent with treatment by surgical debulking and hormonal thyroid suppression. Flow cytometric study of 26 cases showed tumor aneuploidy in 8 of 21 papillary carcinomas and 2 of 3 follicular carcinomas. Aneuploidy did not, however, correlate with clinical outcome in this group of pediatric patients, who were followed for 1 to 29 years. Analysis of multiple tissue blocks of tumor does appear to increase the probability of identifying aneuploid populations.",Thyroid_Cancer

Fifty-one women with lung cancer and 163 other hospital patients were interviewed regarding the smoking habits of themselves and their husbands. Forty of the lung cancer cases and 149 of the other patients were non-smokers. Among the non-smoking women there was a statistically significant difference between the cancer cases and the other patients with respect to their husbands' smoking habits. Estimates of the relative risk of lung cancer associated with having a husband who smokes were 2.4 for a smoker of less than one pack and 3.4 for women whose husbands smoked more than one pack of cigarettes per day. The limitations of the data are examined; it is evident that further investigation of this issue is warranted.,Lung_Cancer
"Machine learning (ML) is a collection of algorithms allowing computers to learn directly from data without predetermined equations. It is used widely to analyze ""big data"". In gastrointestinal surgery, surgeons deal with various data such as clinical parameters, surgical videos, and pathological images, to stratify surgical risk, perform safe surgery and predict patient prognosis. In the current ""big data"" era, the accelerating accumulation of a large amount of data drives studies using ML algorithms. Three subfields of ML are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In this review, we summarize applications of ML to surgical practice in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of care. Prediction and stratification using ML is promising; however, the current overarching concern is the availability of ML models. Information systems that can manage ""big data"" and integrate ML models into electronic health records are essential to incorporate ML into daily practice. ML is fundamental technology to meaningfully process data that exceeds the capacity of the human mind to comprehend. The accelerating accumulation of a large amount of data is changing the nature of surgical practice fundamentally. Artificial intelligence (AI), represented by ML, is being incorporated into daily surgical practice.",Generic

"Recent maritime cybersecurity accidents reveal that shipping is facing increased exposure to cyber threats, especially due to the fast-growing digitalisation of the sector, leaving vessels and their onboard systems vulnerable to cyberattacks. This research aims at evaluating the relationship among the critical dimensions influencing cybersecurity performance in the maritime industry. To achieve this, six critical dimensions related to cybersecurity preparedness are first identified through literature review, namely 'regulations', 'company procedures' from a managerial perspective and 'shipboard systems readiness', 'training and awareness', 'human factor' and 'compliance monitoring' at an operation level. A Likert-scale questionnaire is designed and used to collect empirical data from 133 seafarers and shore-based staff. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is applied to examine the causal relationships between the six dimensions and shipboard cybersecurity performance. The results show that 'regulations' positively influence shipping companies' cybersecurity-related 'procedures', which in turn positively affects 'shipboard systems readiness', 'training and awareness', and 'monitoring'. Further, 'training and awareness' positively influences the cybersecurity performance of ships. The results have profound implications for the shipping industry on how to strengthen their cyber practices in order to improve their cybersecurity performance. Recommendations for future academic research related to maritime cybersecurity are also provided.",Generic
"Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Approximately three quarters of patients are diagnosed with disease limited to the bowel wall or surrounding lymph nodes. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in the treatment of localized colon cancer. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy has improved prognosis in stage III disease, but much work remains to be done in optimizing adjuvant treatment. The FOLFOX4 regimen is now considered standard treatment for stage III disease. Combinations of irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) have not proven to be more effective than 5-FU/folinic acid. In stage II, the value of post-operative treatment remains controversial, but the identification of histopathological and molecular prognostic factors would allow selection of patients who can benefit from adjuvant treatment. The inclusion of molecular targeted agents in combination regimens with cytotoxins, which have already proven effective in advanced disease, is the main field of development in the most recent protocols of adjuvant therapy.",Colon_Cancer

"The presence of hyperthyroidism is no longer an insurance against the occurrence of thyroid cancer. The combination of the two is common. This is a retrospective study of 355 files of patients followed for differentiated thyroid cancer in the endocrinology department at CHU IBN ROCHD from 1986 to 2014. 12 of those patients were followed for hyperthyroidism, and a fortuitous association with differentiated thyroid cancer was found during the anatomopathological exam, giving us a 3.38% prevalence. The average age of discovery is 44.8 years, with a marked female predominance (8/12). Eight patients had a toxic nodule, 3 had Basedow's goiters, and one had Graves' disease. All underwent total thyroidectomy. In all patients, the cancer was a papillary carcinoma. Microcarcinoma was the most predominant (6 patients). An insular carcinoma was found in a patient with spinal and retro-orbital metastases. Treatment with radioactive iodine was prescribed to five patients. The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism does not eliminate the possibility of an associated thyroid cancer. Malignancy should always be kept in mind and therefore lead to a diagnostic approach comparable to that for any thyroid nodule.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Digito-palmar dermatoglyphics in 93 subjects with thyroid cancer (34 males, 59 females) of which 87.1% had folliculo-papillar adenocarcinoma were studied qualitatively and quantitatively. The findings were compared to the dermatoglyphics of 100 males and 100 females from the clinically healthy autochthonous population. The thyroid cancer subjects had a lower total digital ridge count (TDRC) and a reduced number of papillar ridges between the a-d triradii, than the control subjects. The A line showed a more marked transversality in cancer males and a more marked obliquity in cancer females. Qualitative examination showed more patterns in the second interdigital area and a higher incidence of typical and atypical form of sulcus transversus in the cancer group as against the controls. Qualitative and quantitative variations in dermatoglyphics were found with respect to the relation between the anatomo-pathologic form and the A, B, or O blood group.

"In a recent article, we reported a restorative therapeutic intervention that turned individual thyroid cancer lesions into more efficient tissues for taking up radioactive iodine (RAI), resulting in clinically significant and durable responses. A group of Iodine-131 refractory thyroid cancer patients were treated with the MEK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) selumetinib, and RAI uptake was restored in a subset of patients. We employed Iodine-124 positron emission tomography to measure radiation absorbed dose, on a lesion by lesion basis. The process can be thought of as a re-differentiation of the cancer toward a more nearly normal state most like the tissue from which the cancer arose. Remarkably, in its own way, a change was detected within a few weeks of treatment, restoring uptake with therapeutically effective levels of RAI and in some patients, previously completely refractory to radioiodine treatment. In this article, we summarize the basic work that led to this seminal study, and make the case for lesional dosimetry in thyroid cancer with Iodine-124 as a new optimal radiotracer for precision medicine in patients with well differentiated thyroid cancer.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Some cancer types are strongly associated with chronic inflammatory or infectious diseases whereas others are not, but an inflammatory component is present in most human neoplastic lesions. This review focuses on various aspects of thyroid cancer and inflammation. The incidence of thyroid cancer, in particular of well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), is increased in autoimmune thyroid diseases such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Thyroid cancer often has an inflammatory cell infiltrate, which includes lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and mast cells, whose role in thyroid cancer is still not completely understood. However, most experimental evidence suggests these cells exert a protumorigenic function. Moreover, oncoproteins typically expressed in human PTCs, such as RET/PTC, RAS, and BRAF, trigger a proinflammatory programme in thyreocytes. These data suggest that inflammatory molecules are promising targets for thyroid cancer therapy.",Thyroid_Cancer

"The incidence of bronchogenic carcinoma is increasing as life expectancy rises. With increase in the aged population in Japan, the number of patients suffering from lung cancer and candidates for lung resections are increasing.

"The most practical approach to reduce the morbidity and mortality of cancer is to delay the process of carcinogenesis through the use of chemopreventive agents. This necessitates that safer compounds, especially those derived from natural sources must be critically examined for chemoprevention. A spice common to India and the surrounding regions, is turmeric, derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa. Pre-clinical studies in a variety of cancer cell lines including breast, cervical, colon, gastric, hepatic, leukemia, oral epithelial, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate have consistently shown that curcumin possesses anti-cancer activity in vitro and in pre-clinical animal models. The robust activity of curcumin in colorectal cancer has led to five phase I clinical trials being completed showing the safety and tolerability of curcumin in colorectal cancer patients. To date clinical trials have not identified a maximum tolerated dose of curcumin in humans with clinical trials using doses up to 8000mg per day. The success of these trials has led to the development of phase II trials that are currently enrolling patients.

"Well-differentiated follicular carcinoma causing thyrotoxicosis is a rare entity. The age and sex distribution is no different from that of other patients with follicular carcinoma, with 87% older than the age of 40 and a female:male ratio of 3:1. The clinical presentation is similar to that of Graves' patients except that evidence of metastatic disease is often present (soft tissue masses, bone pain). The metastases are in the usual locations (bone, lung, mediastinum) and are often bulky. Despite the poor efficiency of iodine uptake and thyroid hormone production, the large tumor mass is capable of producing excessive hormone. Laboratory data confirm the hyperthyroid state, but the occurrence of T3 elevations with normal T4 levels is common, and T3 toxicosis may be missed if only T4 levels are measured. The role of thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins is still evolving, but such stimulators may support the growth of metastatic thyroid carcinoma and promote the development of hyperthyroidism. The treatment of these patients varied. Most had thyroidectomy followed by 131I therapy. Dosimetry allows for the administration of the largest dose of 131I with acceptable side effects. A good response to radioiodine predicted a more favorable outcome.

This has been facilitated and catalyzed by an appreciation and deep understanding of the forms of colorectal cancer that harbor an inherited predisposition, including familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) or Lynch syndrome, the hamartomatous polyposis syndromes, and certain other rare syndromes. Identification of germline mutations in pivotal genes underlying the inherited forms of colorectal cancer has yielded many dividends, including functional dissection of critical molecular pathways that have been revealed to be important in development, cellular homeostasis, and cancer; new approaches in chemoprevention, molecular diagnostics and genetic testing, and therapy; and underscoring genotypic-phenotypic relationships.",Colon_Cancer
"The current letter describes the rational behind breath analysis of lung cancer and the progress made so far by means of mass spectrometry and smart sensor arrays. Additionally, it presents and discusses the potential of breath analysis in enabling inexpensive and non-invasive technology that would allow efficient early detection of cancer; stratifying the population based on their bio-specification for a tailored (personalized) therapy; and bed-side fast assessment of treatment efficacy in order to change the therapeutic approach. At the end, the letter pinpoints the main implementation strengths of the method as a routine diagnostic and monitoring in the digital era.",Lung_Cancer
"Machine learning enables computers to address problems by learning from data. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses a hierarchical recombination of features to extract pertinent information and then learn the patterns represented in the data. Over the last eight years, its abilities have increasingly been applied to a wide variety of chemical challenges, from improving computational chemistry to drug and materials design and even synthesis planning. This review aims to explain the concepts of deep learning to chemists from any background and follows this with an overview of the diverse applications demonstrated in the literature. We hope that this will empower the broader chemical community to engage with this burgeoning field and foster the growing movement of deep learning accelerated chemistry.",Generic

"Mass screening for detecting both thyroid and breast cancer in adult women was carried out in Gunma Prefecture, Japan, between 1980 and 1986. The total number of subjects during the seven years was 152,651. The first screening was by inspection and palpation using experienced surgeons. Thyroid abnormalities were found in 5,902 subjects (3.9%) and 3,804 (2.5%) were required to attend a second examination. Thyroid carcinoma was detected in a total of 216 subjects, a detection rate of 0.14%. The detection rate for thyroid cancer was twice as high at the initial screening (0.19%) than that at subsequent periodic screenings (0.09%). Histological classifications of the detected thyroid cancers were: papillary carcinoma, 189 cases (87.5%); follicular carcinoma, 26 (12%); medullary carcinoma, 1 (0.5%). Eighty-seven percent of the thyroid cancers were asymptomatic at the time of screening. The tumor size were 2 cm or less in 126 patients (58.3%). Thyroid cancer detected by mass screening was revealed at an earlier stage and showed a significantly better survival rate compared to that of our usual outpatients. As differentiated carcinoma has been found at a higher incidence by mass screening, the program is useful for the early detection and treatment of thyroid cancer.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Thyroid cancer is rare in children but its incidence is increasing. Recent data have clarified important similarities and differences between thyroid cancers originating in childhood and in adulthood. The genetic drivers of pediatric thyroid cancers are similar to those in adult tumors but comprise more gene fusions and fewer point mutations. Clinically, despite frequent metastatic spread, pediatric thyroid cancer has an excellent prognosis and mortality is rare. Therefore, treatment approaches must weigh carefully the morbidity of thyroid cancer treatments against their benefits. Current key questions include which children require total thyroidectomy rather than more limited-and safer-lobectomy, and in which children does the benefit of radioactive iodine therapy outweigh its risk of inducing a secondary malignancy. Finally, molecular therapies targeting genetic drivers of thyroid cancer now provide effective treatment for children with progressive, radioiodine-refractory disease, as well as opportunities to explore novel neoadjuvant uses that facilitate therapeutic surgery or radioactive iodine.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Thyroid cancer metastasizes to regional lymph nodes early and often. The impact of these metastases on outcome depends on the histological subtype and the size, number and location of those metastases, as well as patient's age. Whilst clinically apparent lateral nodal metastases have a significant impact on both survival and recurrence, microscopic metastases to the central as well as lateral neck in well differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC) do not affect outcome. In this review article we discuss the lymphatic drainage of the thyroid gland, and assessment of regional lymph nodes. We go onto describe the impact that nodal metastases have on outcome, before discussing the role of therapeutic and prophylactic neck dissection. Whilst all authors support the use of therapeutic neck dissection, there is considerable controversy over prophylactic central neck dissection. Despite a significant rate of occult disease in the central compartment of clinically negative necks, removal of this tissue results in morbidity without improving outcome. The role of the neck node metastases in decision making in relation to adjuvant radioactive iodine is discussed as is the process of post operative surveillance, and the role of observation in small volume persistent nodal disease. The focus of this article is WDTC, however the principles of management of the neck in medullary and anaplastic carcinoma are also discussed.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Perforation of the colon is a rare complication for patients with colon cancer and usually requires emergent surgery. The characteristics of perforation differ based on the site of perforation, presenting as either perforation at the cancer site or perforation proximal to the cancer site. Peritonitis due to perforation tends to be more severe in cases of perforation proximal to the cancer site; however, the difference in the outcome between the two types remains unclear. Surgical treatment of colon cancer with perforation has changed over time. Recently, many reports have shown the safety and effectiveness of single-stage operation consisting of resection and primary anastomosis with intraoperative colonic lavage. Under certain conditions, laparoscopic surgery can be feasible and help minimize the invasion. However, emergent surgery for colon cancer with perforation is associated with a high rate of mortality and morbidity. The long-term prognosis seems to have no association with the existence of perforation. Oncologically curative resection may be warranted for perforated colon cancer. In this report, we perform a literature review and investigate the characteristics and surgical strategy for colon cancer with perforation.",Colon_Cancer
"Only about half of eligible individuals undergo colon cancer screening. We have limited knowledge about the patient beliefs that adversely affect screening decisions and about which beliefs might be amenable to change through education. As part of a clinical trial, 641 rural Iowans, aged 52 to 79 years, reported their beliefs about colon cancer screening in response to a mailed questionnaire. Consenting subjects were randomized into four groups, which were distinguished by four levels of increasingly intensive efforts to promote screening. Two of the groups received mailed educational materials and completed a follow-up questionnaire, which allowed us to determine whether their beliefs about screening changed following the education. We also completed a factor analysis to identify underlying (latent) factors that might explain the responses to 33 questions about readiness, attitudes, and perceived barriers related to colon cancer screening. The strongest predictors of a patient's stated readiness to be screened were a physician's recommendation to be screened (1 point difference on 10-point Likert scale, 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.5 to 1.6 point difference), a family history of colon cancer (0.85-point Likert scale difference, 95 % CI, 0.1 to 1.6), and a belief that health-care decisions should be mostly left to physicians rather than patients (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.21, P < .001). Of the 33 questionnaire items about screening beliefs, 11 (33 %) changed favorably following the educational intervention. In the factor analysis, the 33 items were reduced to 8 underlying factors, such as being too busy to undergo screening and worries about screening procedures. We found a limited number of underlying factors that may help explain patient resistance to colon cancer screening.",Colon_Cancer
"Lung cancer is associated with a number of cytogenetic abnormalities, such as chromosomal deletions on 3p, 12q, and 17p, which suggest the involvement of multiple tumor suppressor genes. These findings led to the discovery of the inactivation of the Rb and p53 genes in lung cancer. Recent remarkable progress in molecular biology should add a number of genes to the list of tumor suppressor gene involved in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. In addition, dominant oncogenes as well growth factors and their receptors have been shown to be involved in this process. Our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this fatal disease will now allow us to design new strategies to better diagnose and treat lung cancer. In this symposium, we discuss how the molecular oncological approach can be used to reduce the rapidly increasing rates of death due to lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer
"Dietary fat is digested and absorbed in the small intestine and can then be utilized as an energy source and/or as a reservoir for other bioactive lipid species. Excessive dietary fat has been implicated in the induction and/or aggravation of several diseases, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Diets with high fat content have been shown to exacerbate CRC through regulation of intestinal inflammation and proliferation, as well as alteration of bile acid pools, microbiota, and bioactive lipid species. This chapter will investigate the effects of dietary fat on CRC development and pathobiology, and possible mechanisms for specific lipid species in those processes.",Colon_Cancer
"Is any one combination therapy for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) superior to other regimens for metastatic NSCLC? The answer is ""probably no."" More than 4,000 patients with advanced NSCLC participated in randomized trials presented at the 37th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. TAX326 was the only study in which the investigational arm (cisplatin/docetaxel) showed a statistically significant difference in survival compared with the reference standard (cisplatin/vinorelbine). We did learn, however, that what we administer may make some difference: cisplatin might be superior to carboplatin, and patients treated with nonplatinum chemotherapy regimens have a trend toward poorer survival than those who receive platinum doublets. Although there is still no clear best regimen for advanced NSCLC, we may now know how much chemotherapy to give: a randomized study presented found that four cycles produces as much survival benefit as treating until progression. The most significant abstracts presented at this year's lung cancer session involved the use of novel agents with unique mechanisms of action. The median survival in the large, randomized trials of chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC remains a bleak 9 months. ISIS 3521, an antisense oligonucleotide that targets protein kinase C, was found to produce a near doubling of survival when combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel. OSI-774, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was shown to have impressive single agent activity in the second-line treatment of lung cancer. The future of lung cancer therapy will involve combining these novel agents with active chemotherapy regimens in an effort to improve outcome. While we appear to have reached a plateau in what we can accomplish with various combinations of cytotoxic chemotherapy in metastatic NSCLC, in locally-advanced disease new chemotherapy combinations can achieve remarkable results when combined with radiation therapy. The Southwest Oncology Group presented unprecedented phase II data on the use of cisplatin and etoposide with concurrent radiation therapy followed by consolidation docetaxel in patients with stage IIIB NSCLC.",Lung_Cancer

"The thyroid cancer is a rare oncological entity, representing no more than 1% of all human malignant neoplasms. Recently, it has been demonstrated a sharp increase in incidence of differentiated thyroid carcinoma, equally occurring in both sexes. So far, multiple genetic alterations have been identified in differentiated thyroid carcinoma, leading to investigate the clinical utility of genetic studies. In particular, molecular genetic approaches searching for gene mutations in the material collected by fine needle ago-biopsy may have a particular utility in small nodules and in those specimens with an indeterminate cytology. The expansion of knowledge about genetic mutations occurring in different thyroid tumors has characterized recent years, allowing the identification of a correlation between specific mutations and phenotypic characteristics of thyroid cancers, essential for their prognosis. This review will briefly report on the histological features and the new entity represented by thyroid microcarcinoma and will focus on both environmental and genetic aspects associated with the occurrence of thyroid cancer.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Radiation-induced damage is a complex network of interlinked signaling pathways, which may result in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and cancer. The development of thyroid cancer in response to radiation, from nuclear catastrophes to chemotherapy, has long been an object of study. A basic overview of the ionizing and non-ionizing radiation effects of the sensitivity of the thyroid gland on radiation and cancer development has been provided. In this review, we focus our attention on experiments in cell cultures exposed to ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light, and proton beams. Studies on the involvement of specific genes, proteins, and lipids are also reported. This review also describes how lipids are regulated in response to the radiation-induced damage and how they are involved in thyroid cancer etiology, invasion, and migration and how they can be used as both diagnostic markers and drug targets.",Thyroid_Cancer
"ARID3A is upregulated in colorectal cancer and can promote the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells. However, patients with higher level of ARID3A have a better prognosis. This study aimed to uncover the mechanism by which ARID3A benefits the prognosis of colon cancer. Our results indicated that ARID3A upregulation enhanced the chemosensitivity of colon cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), whereas ARID3A downregulation inhibited the chemosensitivity of colon cancer cells to 5-FU. Through database analysis, we found that AKR1C3, a drug resistance-related gene, was the target of ARID3A. Moreover, AKR1C3 was downregulated in colon cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. Next, we assessed the interaction between AKR1C3 and ARID3A, and found that ARID3A inhibited the transcription of AKR1C3, leading to the downregulation of AKR1C3 in colon cancer cells. We also verified that AKR1C3 inhibited the chemosensitivity of colon cancer cells to 5-FU. Moreover, patients with higher ratio of ARID3A to AKR1C3 had a better prognosis. This study suggested that ARID3A promoted chemosensitivity of colon cancer cells by inhibiting AKR1C3 in colon cancer. The ratio of ARID3A to AKR1C3 is a good marker to predict the prognosis of colon cancer patients.",Colon_Cancer

"Comparisons were made for unstaged lung cancer cases both to ""staged"" lung cancer cases and to unstaged cases from all other sites, in Kentucky for 1996-2000. Principal findings were that the likelihood of the lung cancer cases to be unstaged was greater when the cancer incidence report came from sources other than a hospital. This may implicate data system forces [for availability of necessary data for completing stage at diagnosis] rather than differences between cases per se. The risk of being unstaged by smoking status was reversed between lung cancer (lower risk) than for all other cancer sites (higher risk), an unexpected pattern. No difference for survival was found for unstaged versus staged lung cancer cases, as well as no differences for race and gender. The finding of no differences suggests that other forces (eg, age, source of payment) may contribute more greatly to one's likelihood of being unstaged with a diagnosis of lung cancer than for ""all other cancer sites."" These patterns pose provocative implications for how smoking status may influence clinical perspectives and those of persons faced with a diagnosis of cancer.",Lung_Cancer
"Surgery and radioiodine therapy are usually effective for most patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. However, poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas represent a challenge to physicians on the basis of the current cancer treatment modalities. These cancer subtypes are often lethal and refractory to radioiodine therapy as well as most of the common chemotherapy drugs. Several kinase inhibitors are promising targeted therapies for these malignancies; however, clinical trials involving these drugs have provided controversial results and their clinical use is still under debate. Advanced medullary thyroid carcinomas may also be refractory to conventional therapies and novel kinase inhibitors may also be useful to control tumor progression in certain patients. Novel evidence is emerging that thyroid cancer is a stem cell disease, thereby implying that the driving force of thyroid cancers is a subset of undifferentiated cells (thyroid cancer stem cells) with unlimited growth potential and resistance to conventional therapeutic regimens. Thyroid cancer stem cells have been proposed as responsible for tumor invasiveness, metastasis, relapse and differentiation. Therefore, drugs that selectively target these cells could serve as a cornerstone in the treatment of poorly differentiated thyroid cancer.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), the most common thyroid malignancy, is associated with an excellent prognosis. Overall survival is more than 90%. The first-line treatment is surgical excision, and although the debate continues as to whether a total thyroidectomy or thyroid lobectomy should be recommended, most patients at the University of California, San Francisco are treated with a total thyroidectomy. Not only has this been shown to be superior for overall survival in select patient populations, but local recurrence is also significantly lower with this approach. Total thyroidectomy also optimizes the adjuvant treatment options that are unique to ""differentiated"" thyroid cancer because these malignant cells retain many of the features of the native thyroid follicular cell. These cellular features are used for specialized investigations and treatment options in patients with PTC. For example, PTC cells retain the ability to produce thyroglobulin, to be stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and to take up iodine. These features are vital and separate differentiated thyroid cancer from other epithelial malignancies because such features can be used in clinical follow-up (monitoring serum thyroglobulin levels, whole body radioactive iodine scans) and in the treatment of patients with PTC (TSH suppression, radioactive iodine ablation of thyroid remnant, local recurrences, and regional or distant metastases). In summary, the wide array of treatment options for patients with PTC includes surgery, radioactive iodine, thyroid hormone suppression of TSH, external beam radiation (less commonly), and rarely, chemotherapy. This continues to be an area of exciting research for emerging therapy, much of which concentrates on enhancing or re-establishing the differentiated features of the thyroid cancer cell, in an effort to optimize the adjuvant treatment options. The treatment options that are chosen depend on patient factors, disease factors, and the decisions of the patient and treatment team.",Thyroid_Cancer
"In order for a trauma surgeon to have an intelligent discussion with hospital administrators, healthcare plans, policymakers, or any other physicians, a basic understanding of the fundamentals of healthcare is paramount. It is truly shocking how many surgeons are unable to describe the difference between Medicare and Medicaid or describe how hospitals and physicians get paid. These topics may seem burdensome but they are vital to all business decision making in the healthcare field. The following chapter provides further insight about what we call ""the basics"" of providing medical care today. Most of the topics presented can be applied to all specialties of medicine. It is broken down into 5 sections. The first section is a brief overview of government programs, their influence on care delivery and reimbursement, and past and future legislation. Section 2 focuses on the compliance, care provision, and privacy statutes that regulate physicians who care for Medicare/Medicaid patient populations. With a better understanding of these obligations, section 3 discusses avenues by which physicians can stay informed of current and pending health policy and provides ways that they can become involved in shaping future legislation. The fourth section changes gears slightly by explaining how the concepts of trade restraint, libel, antitrust legislation, and indemnity relate to physician practice. The fifth, and final, section ties all of components together by describing how physician-hospital alignment can be mutually beneficial in providing patient care under current healthcare policy legislation.",Generic
"This paper reviews recent cardiology literature and reports how artificial intelligence tools (specifically, machine learning techniques) are being used by physicians in the field. Each technique is introduced with enough details to allow the understanding of how it works and its intent, but without delving into details that do not add immediate benefits and require expertise in the field. We specifically focus on the principal Machine learning based risk scores used in cardiovascular research. After introducing them and summarizing their assumptions and biases, we discuss their merits and shortcomings. We report on how frequently they are adopted in the field and suggest why this is the case based on our expertise in machine learning. We complete the analysis by reviewing how corresponding statistical approaches compare with them. Finally, we discuss the main open issues in applying machine learning tools to cardiology tasks, also drafting possible future directions. Despite the growing interest in these tools, we argue that there are many still underutilized techniques: while neural networks are slowly being incorporated in cardiovascular research, other important techniques such as semi-supervised learning and federated learning are still underutilized. The former would allow practitioners to harness the information contained in large datasets that are only partially labeled, while the latter would foster collaboration between institutions allowing building larger and better models.",Generic
"Conventional machine learning studies generally assume close-environment scenarios where important factors of the learning process hold invariant. With the great success of machine learning, nowadays, more and more practical tasks, particularly those involving open-environment scenarios where important factors are subject to change, called open-environment machine learning in this article, are present to the community. Evidently, it is a grand challenge for machine learning turning from close environment to open environment. It becomes even more challenging since, in various big data tasks, data are usually accumulated with time, like streams, while it is hard to train the machine learning model after collecting all data as in conventional studies. This article briefly introduces some advances in this line of research, focusing on techniques concerning emerging new classes, decremental/incremental features, changing data distributions and varied learning objectives, and discusses some theoretical issues.",Generic
"The first classic theranostic agent, radioactive iodine was used in the treatment of differentitated thyroid cancer (DTC) and it has an important role in the good prognosis of DTC even nowadays.

The development of other theranostics also aimed the personalized therapy with minimal side effects and optimal therapeutic efficacy.

This required the modification of guidelines to avoid the overtreatment of the disease, in the direction of less radical therapy.

"Major advances in diagnostic technologies are offering unprecedented insight into the condition of the retina and beyond ocular disease. Digital images providing millions of morphological datasets can fast and non-invasively be analyzed in a comprehensive manner using artificial intelligence (AI). Methods based on machine learning (ML) and particularly deep learning (DL) are able to identify, localize and quantify pathological features in almost every macular and retinal disease. Convolutional neural networks thereby mimic the path of the human brain for object recognition through learning of pathological features from training sets, supervised ML, or even extrapolation from patterns recognized independently, unsupervised ML.

"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Besides smoking, epidemiological studies have linked female sex hormones to lung cancer in women; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we report that the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB (RANK), the key regulator of osteoclastogenesis, is frequently expressed in primary lung tumors, an active RANK pathway correlates with decreased survival, and pharmacologic RANK inhibition reduces tumor growth in patient-derived lung cancer xenografts. Clonal genetic inactivation of KRasG12D in mouse lung epithelial cells markedly impairs the progression of KRasG12D -driven lung cancer, resulting in a significant survival advantage. Mechanistically, RANK rewires energy homeostasis in human and murine lung cancer cells and promotes expansion of lung cancer stem-like cells, which is blocked by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. Our data also indicate survival differences in KRasG12D -driven lung cancer between male and female mice, and we show that female sex hormones can promote lung cancer progression via the RANK pathway. These data uncover a direct role for RANK in lung cancer and may explain why female sex hormones accelerate lung cancer development.

"Background Thyroid cancer is one of the most common cancers in women of reproductive age. Our purpose was to evaluate the association between thyroid cancer and maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnancy. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Nationwide Inpatient Sample (HCUP-NIS) database from the US. A cohort consisting of women who delivered between 1999 and 2014 was created. Multivariate logistic regression, controlling for baseline maternal characteristics, was used to compare pregnancy complications and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with thyroid cancer [International Classification of Diseases, ninth edition (ICD-9) code 193] diagnosed before or during pregnancy with those of the obstetric population without thyroid cancer. Results The study included 14,513,587 pregnant women, of which 581 women had a diagnosis of thyroid cancer (4/100,000). During the observation period, there was an upward trend in the prevalence of thyroid cancer among pregnant women, though not statistically significant (P = 0.147). Women with thyroid cancer were more likely to be Caucasian, belong to a higher income quartile, have private insurance, to be discharged from an urban teaching hospital and to have pre-gestational hypertension. Women with thyroid cancer had a greater chance of delivering vaginally, requiring transfusion of blood and developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). Neonates of mothers with thyroid cancer were not found to be at increased risk for the adverse neonatal outcomes examined, specifically, congenital malformations, intrauterine growth restriction, fetal death and preterm labor.

"Each year more than 6000 patients in Poland die from cancer of the colon. Morbidity due to colonic cancer increases rapidly in our country. From 1973 to 1982 there was a three-fold increase in the morbidity due to colonic cancer as compared to the years 1952-1955. Five-year relative survival in the same periods did not improve, either being 28% in men and 27% in women. To compare, in the USA with high morbidity rates due to colonic cancer where each year there are 145,000 new cases of cancer, 5-year relative survival is 42% for men and 54% for women. This raises a question whether our strategy of treatment of colonic cancer is correct. This question is even more justified now when secondary prevention of colonic cancer is of practical value. Total mortality due to colonic cancer is 60%. However, diagnosis and treatment of early forms of colonic cancer reduces mortality to 20% and below. Therefore, effective management colonic cancer should include not only the so-called primary prevention (interfering with etiological factors for instance through high fibers diet) but also secondary prevention through monitoring of precancerous changes in the colon, removal of potentially malignant lesions and early forms of colonic cancer [19]. Secondary prevention interfering with the pathogenesis of colonic cancer is the subject of the present paper. We would like to emphasize the need for a better management program for colonic cancer, especially that the data concerning colonic cancer in Poland may be underestimated due to diagnostic neglect and faulty cancer register.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Colon_Cancer
"Simple Summary Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is commonly used in several solid tumor malignancies, but remains understudied in the setting of locally advanced colon cancer. Advantages of this strategy extrapolated from other disease sites include early treatment of micro-metastatic disease, the ability to decrease local disease burden potentially leading to more effective resections and improved treatment tolerability. Approaches for accurate staging and safe administration of systemic treatment are being investigated in large, randomized clinical trials, but available data are either not mature enough or have not demonstrated a convincing argument for adoption into standard practice warranting further investigation. Abstract Early stage colon cancer is typically managed with surgical resection, although not all patients experience a durable remission. Adjuvant chemotherapy with a fluoropyrimidine, with or without oxaliplatin, is commonly utilized to increase the chance of cure, but its efficacy in the neoadjuvant setting is not well established. Preoperative chemotherapy has demonstrated safety and efficacy in other gastrointestinal malignancies, but there is a paucity of data from large, prospective randomized trials, although multiple are ongoing. In this review, we will discuss the theoretical risks and benefits, logistical difficulties, and available safety and efficacy data pertaining to the use of chemotherapy in locally advanced colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer

"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and in Taiwan. Cigarette smoking is considered to be the most important risk factor, since about 90% of lung cancer can be related to cigarette smoking. Despite the recent decrease of cigarette smoking, lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. In Taiwan, only around 50% of lung cancer incidence could be associated with cigarette smoking, particularly less than 10% of Taiwanese women are smokers. Thus, the aetiology of lung cancer for nonsmokers remains unknown. DNA damages including bulky and oxidative damage may be related with mutation of tumor suppressor genes, such as p53 gene. The high DNA adduct levels in female may be associated with frequent exposure to indoor cooking oil fumes (COF) and outdoor heavy air pollution. Oxidative stress induced by COF was also discussed. Different p53 mutation spectra and mutation frequency between genders reflected that different environmental factors may be involved in nonsmoking male and female lung cancer development. Most importantly, our recent report has demonstrated that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection was associated with nonsmoking female lung cancer. Based on our studies with Taiwanese nonsmoking lung cancer as the model, the possible aetiological factors of lung cancer incidence in Taiwanese nonsmokers were elucidated.",Lung_Cancer
"To the best of our knowledge, only two studies analyzed the relationship between HRV and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in colon cancer patients. The aim of this study was to analyze changes in the autonomic activity of colon cancer patients using heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV) measures, and to verify if HRV and BPV parameters correlate with hemodynamic indices in this group and the plasma levels of CEA. Presence of colon cancer is associated with changes in autonomic activity, namely parasympathetic-sympathetic imbalance in form of sympathetic overdrive. Cancer-related autonomic dysfunction may contribute to impairment of gastrointestinal motility.",Colon_Cancer
"Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality throughout the world representing around 18% of the total. There is still a male predominance but this is becoming less pronounced and in the US, lung cancer is now the most common cause of cancer-related mortality in women. In France, it had risen to second place in women in 2005 after having been in 6th place in 1975. Median age at diagnosis differs according to countries and health system and is around 70 years in the US and around 65 years in France. The distribution of histological subtypes has changed considerably during recent decades with an increasing frequency of adenocarcinoma at the expense of squamous cell carcinoma. The main risk factor for lung cancer remains active tobacco smoking but the attributable risk of smoking varies from one country to another and according to gender. In Japan, the great majority of lung cancer in women is not attributable to active tobacco smoking. Environmental tobacco smoke exposure has a less important role than active tobacco smoking although it is not negligible. The specific impact of smoking cannabis is difficult to assess precisely as, in most cases, it is mixed with tobacco. However, despite important differences with tobacco smoke, cannabis exposure doubles the risk of developing lung cancer. Occupational risk factors have for a long time been neglected and thus occupational lung cancers have been under-reported. Finally, lung cancer in never-smokers is driving considerable interest as it represents by itself the 7th largest cause of mortality due to cancer. Risk factors involved might be air pollution (indoors and outdoors) but also hormone replacement therapy in women.",Lung_Cancer

"The ""Internet-of-Medical-Vehicles (IOMV)"" is one of the special applications of the Internet of Things resulting from combining connected healthcare and connected vehicles. As the IOMV communicates with a variety of networks along its travel path, it incurs various security risks due to sophisticated cyber-attacks. This can endanger the onboard patient's life. So, it is critical to understand subjects related to ""cybersecurity"" in the IOMV to develop robust cybersecurity measures. In this paper, the goal is to evaluate recent trends and state-of-the-art publications, gaps, and future outlooks related to this research area. With this aim, a variety of publications between 2016 and 2023 from ""Web-of-Science"" and ""Scopus"" databases were analysed. Our analysis revealed that the IOMV is a niche and unexplored research area with few defined standards and frameworks, and there is a great need to implement robust cybersecurity measures. This paper will help researchers to gain a comprehensive idea of this niche research topic, as it presents an analysis of top journals and highly cited papers, their challenges and limitations, the system model and architecture of the IOMV, related applicable standards, potential cyber-attacks, factors causing cybersecurity risks, various artificial intelligence techniques for developing potential countermeasures, the assessment and parameterisation of cybersecurity risks, constraints and challenges, and future outlooks for implementing cybersecurity measures in the IOMV.",Generic
"Colon cancer (CC) therapies have improved patient outcomes significantly over the last decades in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings. With the introduction of a number of novel agents, both traditional chemotherapies and biologically targeted agents, the need to identify subgroups that are likely and not likely to respond to a particular treatment regimen is paramount. This will allow patients who are likely to benefit to receive optimal care, while sparing those unlikely to benefit from unnecessary toxicity and cost. With the identification of several novel biomarkers and a variety of technologies to interrogate the genome, we already are able to rapidly study patient tumor or blood samples and normal tissues to generate a large dataset of aberrations within the cancer. How to digest this complex information to obtain accurate, reliable, and meaningful results that will allow us to provide truly personalized care for CC patients is just starting to be addressed. In this article, we briefly review the history of CC treatment, with an emphasis on current clinical standards that incorporate a ""personalized medicine"" approach. We then review strategies that will potentially improve our ability to individualize therapy in the future.",Colon_Cancer
"Familial thyroid cancer is rare, accounting for <10% of thyroid cancer cases.

Familial papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) have been identified as a distinct group of familial thyroid cancers. Sporadic nonmedullary thyroid cancer (NMTC) accounts for approximately 90% of all thyroid cancers-about 6% of NMTCs are familial (FNMTC).

"Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in Switzerland. The nihilism that dominated the treatment of these patients for decades has been replaced by a measure of enthusiasm, given recent therapeutic advances. New anticancer drugs such as irinotecan and oxaliplatin have changed the standard chemotherapy treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. However, the real hype has come from molecular targeted therapy. Identification of cellular processes characteristic of colon cancer has permitted therapeutic targeting with favorable therapeutic index. Inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor in the clinic has provided proof of principle that interruption of signal transduction cascades in patients has therapeutic potential. Angiogenesis, especially the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway, has been proven to be another highly successful molecular target. In this article, we will review molecular targets, which are under active clinical investigation in colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Laparoscopic surgery is widespread in the treatment of colorectal cancer. In Japan, a nationwide survey has shown that the rate of advanced colorectal cancer has increased gradually to 65% of total laparoscopic surgeries in 2007. Many randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that in the short term, laparoscopic surgery is feasible, safe, and has many benefits, including reduction of peri-operative mortality. In terms of long-term outcomes, four randomized controlled trials suggest that there are no differences in laparosupic and open surgery for colon cancer. However, important issues, including long-term oncological outcome, cost effectiveness, and the impact on the quality of life of patients, should be addressed in well-designed large-scale trials. In Japan, a retrospective multicenter study has demonstrated that the short-term outcomes of laparoscopic surgery are beneficial, and the long-term outcomes are the same as for open surgery. In 2004, a prospective large-scale randomized controlled trial (JCOG0404) to compare laparoscopic surgery with open surgery was started to evaluate oncological outcomes for advanced colon cancer. This trial is supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Cancer Research from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare. In the present study, laparoscopic surgery is found to be acceptable for stage I disease of colon cancer, whereas it is controversial for stage II/III disease because of inadequate clinical evidence. Whether laparoscopic surgery is acceptable for advanced colon cancer or not should be confirmed by the Japanese large-scale prospective randomized controlled trial (JCOG0404) in the near future.",Colon_Cancer
"Introduction: Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumor of the digestive system, the incidence of this cruel disease has been increasing at a constant rate. Materials and methods: 236 patients diagnosed with right colon cancer were retrospectively reviewed. For all patients included in this study, right hemicolectomy or extended right hemicolectomy with ileo-colonic anastomosis was performed. Patients were divided in two groups, as follows: study group including patients which developed anastomotic leakage, and control group including patients without anastomotic leak. There were compared clinical, surgical, postoperative and anastomotic leakage (AL) related data within the two groups.The study investigates possible risk and protective factors for developing anastomotic leakage, furthermore the relationship between anastomotic leakage and mortality was analyzed. Results: risk factors for AL as advanced age, tumors of the right 1/3 of transvers colon, emergencysurgery, mechanical suture, S-E anastomosis, late start of bowel motility were identified during the current research. S-S anastomotic technique were identified as protective factor in the development of fistula.

"Cancers of follicular cell origin are the most common of the endocrine malignancies. Thyroid cancers are seen with increased frequency after radiation exposure and in some familial syndromes. Interestingly, the prognosis of thyroid carcinoma is highly dependent on the age of the patient at the time of examination: several clinical staging systems facilitate appropriate treatment planning. The ability of the follicular cell to take up iodine permits the use of radioactive iodine for follow-up and therapy. After thyroidectomy and radioiodine ablation, thyroglobulin becomes a sensitive marker for the presence of recurrent or metastatic disease. Patients who are thyroglobulin-positive but radioiodine-negative or who have antithyroglobulin antibodies are a clinical challenge. Improvement in imaging studies can help in the treatment of these patients. New treatments, such as the use of agents to improve iodine uptake in follicular cell tumors, are in early clinical investigation; others are in experimental development but hold promise for the treatment of aggressive thyroid malignancies.",Thyroid_Cancer

"It has been postulated that dietary fiber's protective effect against the development of colon cancer, diverticular disease, and atherosclerosis may be due to the adsorption and/or dilution of intestinal sterols such as bile acids and neural sterols and their bacterial metabolites by component(s) of fiber. Dietary fiber is made up of four major components-cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and pectin. There is evidence that hemicellulose and pectin may induce an increase in fecal bile acid excretion in man which may be accompanied by a decrease in serum cholesterol. Natural fibers, such as rolled oats, alfalfa, guar gum, and Bengal gram have been shown to have hypocholesterolemic properties of alfalfa, wheat straw, and some other fibers found considerable amounts of bile acids in vitro. On the other hand, wheat bran, oat hulls, and all the synthetic fibers tested bound only negligible amounts of bile acids under the same conditions. Vegetarians in the United States have lower plasma lipids and different plasma lipoprotein patterns than those of comparable control populations on regular mixed diet. They also have smaller daily fractional turnover rates of cholic acid and deoxycholic acid pool size. In addition, populations on a mixed Western diet, where the rate of large bowel cancer is high (North American, English, Scottish, etc.) degraded and excreted cholesterol and bile acid metabolites to a greater degree than populations where the rate of colon cancer is comparatively low (Ugandan, Japanese, etc). It cannot be denied that the fiber theory linking fiber deficiency with the development of colon cancer and other diseases, is simple, attractive and appears to be firmly based in common sense. When subjected to research studies, however, the situation appears much more complex than expected. Although some progress is being made, the data are often contradictory and confusing, probably due to lack of adequate documentation of fiber intake (e.g., use of dietary fiber instead of crude fiber) and/or the absence of detailed information on the chemistry of the fiber itself.",Colon_Cancer
"From 1958 to 1979 1,951 pulmonary resections for lung cancer were performed in our hospital.

The operative mortality rate for this procedure showed no difference to that for lobectomy at the same stage. The 5-year survival rate for these segment resection patients was 23%, while it was 45% for lobectomy patients. Consequently, segment resection cannot be regarded as a routine method, but rather as an emergency procedure in functionally otherwise inoperable cases.",Lung_Cancer

"Female lung cancer death rates increased by more than 550 percent between 1950 and 1991. In 1986 lung cancer surpassed breast cancer to become the leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. The lung cancer epidemic is primarily attributable to cigarette smoking, which is responsible for at least 80% of the disease in women. There are gender differences in the distribution of lung cancer by histologic type, even controlling for smoking, and some data suggest greater female than male susceptibility to lung cancer at a given level of smoking. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke increases risk of lung cancer in nonsmoking women. Family history of lung cancer, personal history of lung disease (e.g. asthma, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, or tuberculosis), and a history of radiotherapy also appear to be associated with increased risk. Data specific to women on the role of household radon exposures or of specific occupational or environmental exposures are relatively sparse and inconsistent. Finally, many studies have reported a decreased risk of lung cancer in individuals who consume high levels of fruits and vegetables; however, clinical trials fail to support a beneficial effect of beta-carotene supplementation. Since cigarette smoking accounts for the vast majority of lung cancer cases in women, efforts to prevent adolescent girls from starting to smoke and to encourage cessation among established smokers have the greatest potential for reducing the female lung cancer burden.",Lung_Cancer
"Background An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm has been developed for fully automated body composition assessment of lung cancer screening noncontrast low-dose CT of the chest (LDCT) scans, but the utility of these measurements in disease risk prediction models has not been assessed. Purpose To evaluate the added value of CT-based AI-derived body composition measurements in risk prediction of lung cancer incidence, lung cancer death, cardiovascular disease (CVD) death, and all-cause mortality in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). Materials and Methods In this secondary analysis of the NLST, body composition measurements, including area and attenuation attributes of skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue, were derived from baseline LDCT examinations by using a previously developed AI algorithm. The added value of these measurements was assessed with sex- and cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models with and without the AI-derived body composition measurements for predicting lung cancer incidence, lung cancer death, CVD death, and all-cause mortality. Models were adjusted for confounding variables including age; body mass index; quantitative emphysema; coronary artery calcification; history of diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and stroke; and other PLCOM2012 lung cancer risk factors. Goodness-of-fit improvements were assessed with the likelihood ratio test. Results Among 20 768 included participants (median age, 61 years [IQR, 57-65 years]; 12 317 men), 865 were diagnosed with lung cancer and 4180 died during follow-up. Including the AI-derived body composition measurements improved risk prediction for lung cancer death (male participants: 2 = 23.09, P 2 = 15.04, P = .002), CVD death (males: 2 = 69.94, P 2 = 16.60, P 2 = 248.13, P 2 = 94.54, P 2 = 2.53, P = .11; female participants: 2 = 1.73, P = .19). Conclusion The body composition measurements automatically derived from baseline low-dose CT examinations added predictive value for lung cancer death, CVD death, and all-cause death, but not for lung cancer incidence in the NLST.

"Many studies have been performed to determine the interaction between bacterial species and cancer. However, there has been no attempts to demonstrate a possible relationship between Enterobacter spp. and colon cancer so far. Therefore, in the present study, it is aimed to investigate the effects of Enterobacter strains on colon cancer. Bacterial proteins were isolated from 11 Enterobacter spp., one Morganella morganii, and one Escherichia coli strains, and applied onto NCM460 (Incell) and CRL1790 (ATCC) cell lines. Cell viability and proliferation were determined in MTS assay. Flow Cytometry was used to detect CD24 level and apoptosis. Real-Time PCR studies were performed to determine NFKB and Bcl2 expression. Graphpad Software was used for statistical analysis. The results showed that proteins, isolated from the Enterobacter spp., have significantly increased cell viability and proliferation, while decreasing the apoptosis of the cell lines tested. The data in the present study indicated that Enterobacter strains might promote colon cancer. Moreover, Enterobacter spp. could be a clinically important factor for colon cancer initiation and progression.

"While epidemiologic and concordant experimental data indicate a direct relationship between dietary fat (and presumably caloric) intake and the development of colon cancer, the effect of dietary cholesterol on this disease is still not clear. However, there appears to be a developing literature concerning an inverse relationship between serum and plasma cholesterol levels, and the risk for colon cancer. Findings that low serum cholesterol levels are apparent as early as ten years prior to the detection of colon cancer implies that sub clinical disease is probably not involved initially in this process. The possibility of low serum cholesterol as a bio-marker was considered in epidemiologic studies which focused upon obese men with lower than normal serum cholesterol levels who were found to be at increased risk to colon cancer. While the relationship between low serum cholesterol and colonic or intestinal cholesterol metabolism is presently not understood, current genetic studies provide a promising though as yet unexplored potential association. Alterations which occur during the developmental progression of colonic cancer include changes in chromosome 5, which also carries two genes vital to the biosynthesis and regulation of systemic and cellular cholesterol metabolism, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoA R). Regulation of cholesterol metabolism in intestinal cells in vivo and in vitro varies from that seen in normal fibroblasts or hepatocytes in terms of exogenous sources of cholesterol and how these sources regulate internal synthesis. Colonic cancer cells have been used to assess small bowel enterocyte cholesterol metabolism, which has been possible because of their ability to differentiate in culture, however information regarding true colonic enterocyte cholesterol metabolism is relatively scarce. Colonic cancer cells have been shown to possess a diminished or nonexistent ability to use low density lipoprotein to support cellular growth, unlike normal fibroblasts. Diminished low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDL-R) activity is a significant alteration in a metabolic pathway with such fundamental ties to cellular growth and activation (via mevalonate effects on isoprenylation of G-proteins for example), that it is selected for in the development of certain tumors--among them human colonic carcinomas. It would be expected that such a loss would provide a growth advantage to the tumor cell. Preliminary investigation of this hypothesis has shown that LDL will inhibit the proliferative capacity of certain human colonic adenocarcinomas, and that these cells possess a high rate of cholesterol synthesis relative to fibroblasts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Colon_Cancer
"In a case-control study of colon cancer conducted in three geographic regions of the United States, 1993 case subjects and 2410 control subjects were interviewed. In addition to queries regarding other known or suspected risk factors, subjects were asked about their use of eight drugs or drug groups. Two of these, aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), have been inversely associated with risk in other studies. Three others--asthma medications, digitalis preparations, and phenmetrazine--were positively associated and the last three--diazepam, penicillin, and phenformin--were negatively associated with risk of colon cancer in an earlier study that screened pharmaceuticals for possible carcinogenic effects. Reported use of aspirin and NSAIDs were both inversely related to risk with essentially the same odds ratios (0.7, 95% confidence interval 0.6-0.8) for both drugs in both univariate and multivariate analyses controlling for use of each other and for other colon cancer risk factors. Subdivision by age at starting the drug, duration of use, latency interval, sex, race, family history of colon cancer, or proximal versus distal cancer revealed no substantial differences among subgroups for either aspirin or NSAIDs, but reduced risk was associated primarily with recent aspirin use. Phenformin showed a strong positive association but the data concerning this drug appeared to be inaccurate. The other drugs and drug groups showed essentially no association with colon cancer risk.",Colon_Cancer

"Cancer of the thyroid gland in pediatric patients is rare and if left untreated spreads and become lethal. Thyroid nodules in pediatric patients are four times more likely being malignant than adult nodules. The incidence of thyroid cancer in children increases with age, sex, race and nodule size. Exposures to low level of head and neck irradiation at young age, cancer survivors, family history of thyroid cancer and iodine deficiency are specific risk factors to develop thyroid cancer. Thyroid cancer is subdivided into papillary, follicular and medullary thyroid cancer varying in histological characteristics. Children who present with thyroid nodules should undergo ultrasound and fine needle aspiration biopsy to evaluate malignant potential. If biopsy results are positive for malignancy best option is complete surgical resection of the thyroid gland with central lymph node dissection followed by radioactive iodine treatment. Surgeons need to take certain precaution to avoid postoperative complications like hypoparathyroidism or recurrent laryngeal nerve damage. Follow-up is essential in order to evaluate remission or recurrence. An excellent prognosis in pediatric patients is the result of such an aggressive approach that can be supported by the low complications rate and low recurrence rate following surgery.",Thyroid_Cancer

"There are few relationships in the epidemiology of cancer between an exposure and disease that are as consistent as those observed between tobacco and lung cancer. The health consequences of tobacco use are not limited to lung cancer; the 1990 Surgeon General's Report described that the use of cigarettes was the leading cause of avoidable mortality in the United States, with about 434,000 preventable deaths per year. Although a majority of the adults in the United States are current or former smokers, smoking cessation and prevention efforts have been successful, although currently about one in four adults still smoke cigarettes. The decline in ever-smoking has reached a plateau in the past few years, however, and rates of teenage smoking have begun to increase. In 1997, smoking rates among high school students in the United States were 32% higher compared with 1991. As noted by Cinciripini et al, adult smokers who quit or die are being replaced by children who smoke. Until recently, lung cancer control efforts primarily have focused on smoking prevention in youth and cessation among adults, with little obvious potential for reducing deaths through early detection. With the recent publication of early results from the Early Lung Cancer Action Project showing remarkably more favorable screening performance compared with chest radiography, the potential to detect lung cancer early and save lives is being revisited. Ultimately, the preferred disease control strategy is the prevention of lung cancer through the elimination of tobacco use altogether, but for the foreseeable future a legacy of decades of tobacco use in a significant proportion of the US population means we are still challenged to develop public health strategies to reduce deaths and suffering from those destined to develop lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer

The potential for resection in cases of mediastinal invasion and other advanced disease places special demands on imaging techniques.

Slight increments in improving accuracy in the evaluation of nodal disease has been shown by using different size criteria for different nodal stations and by evaluating nodal architecture or extracapsular spread. CT remains cost-effective in the overall evaluation of the patients, enabling the direction of invasive procedures and the elimination of unnecessary ones.

"Selenium is an essential trace element that has been implicated in cancer risk; however, study results have been inconsistent with regard to colon cancer. Our objectives were to 1) investigate the association between selenium and colon cancer, 2) evaluate possible effect measure modifiers, and 3) evaluate potential biases associated with the use of postdiagnostic serum selenium measures. The North Carolina Colon Cancer Study is a large population-based, case-control study of colon cancer in North Carolina between 1996 and 2000 (n = 1,691). Nurses interviewed patients about diet and lifestyle and drew blood specimens, which were used to measure serum selenium. Individuals who had both high serum selenium (> 140 mcg/l) and high reported folate (> 354 mcg/day) had a reduced relative risk of colon cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 0.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.4-0.8). The risk of colon cancer for those with high selenium and low folate was approximately equal to the risk among those with low selenium and low folate (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.7-1.5) as was the risk for those with low selenium and high folate (OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.7-1.2). We did not find evidence of bias due to weight loss, stage at diagnosis, or time from diagnosis to selenium measurement. High levels of serum selenium and reported folate jointly were associated with a substantially reduced risk of colon cancer. Folate status should be taken into account when evaluating the relation between selenium and colon cancer in future studies. Importantly, weight loss, stage at diagnosis, or time from diagnosis to blood draw did not appear to produce strong bias in our study.",Colon_Cancer
"Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant tumor of the endocrine system. The most frequent type of thyroid malignancy is papillary carcinoma. Thyroid cancer's incidence rates have increased over the last three decades throughout the world. Numerous studies have documented that radiation exposure is a well-established risk factor for the thyroid cancer. It has been reported that exposure to external medical radiation or to external and internal radiation from atomic bomb explosions, nuclear tests or nuclear accidents leads to an increased risk for thyroid cancer. The risk of thyroid cancer is maximal during the first years of life and decreases with increasing age at exposure due to morphologic and functional heterogeneity in the thyroid tissue of children and adults. Also it has been indicated that iodine deficiency increases the risk of the thyroid cancer related to radioactive iodines in case of exposure to radioactive iodines in childhood and the stable iodine supplementation reduces this risk. Ionizing radiation produces a range of mutations in irradiated cells of the thyroid. The prevalence of RET/PTC mutations is significantly higher in papillary carcinomas from childhood patients with the precedent history of radiation.",Thyroid_Cancer
"A cohort of 52 subjects diagnosed with acromegaly in southeastern Michigan and northern Ohio between 1935 and 1985 were followed to determine the incidence of colon cancer and polyps. Medical records were reviewed, subjects or their next-of-kin were interviewed, and screening examinations of the colon were offered to the living patients who were located. Data on demographics, personal histories of cancer and colon polyps, family history of colon cancer, and cure from acromegaly were obtained for both living and deceased subjects. The risk for colon cancer compared to the general population was estimated using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). The expected number of cases was determined utilizing age, sex and race-specific rates provided by the cancer registry in southeastern Michigan. Among the 52 subjects, one could not be located and nine were deceased, none from colon cancer, with one known to have a history of colon polyps. Of 13 (31%) who declined the screening physical, one had a history of polyps and none reported a history of colon cancer. Two of 29 screened patients were found to have right-sided adenocarcinoma of the colon. Of the entire cohort, eight people (including one deceased) had a current or previous diagnosis of polyps, with five known to be histologically adenomatous. The SIR for colon cancer was 4.7 (95% confidence interval 0.6-17.1). Seven subjects, including the two with detected adenocarcinoma and four of the six living subjects with polyps only, reported a family history of colon cancer. The SIR for the subset of subjects with a family history of colon cancer was 29.1 (95% confidence interval of 3.5-104.6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Colon_Cancer

"Studies have confirmed that TrkB plays important roles in facilitating metastasis in various types of malignant tumors. In the present study, 30 cases of colon cancer and matched non-tumors were examined for the expression of TrkB by Western blot. The expression of TrkB was also examined in 90 colon tumor sections by immunohistochemical methods, and D2-40 staining was used to evaluate the correlation between TrkB expression and lymphatic vessel density. To investigate the effects of TrkB on the progression of colon cancer, siRNA specific for TrkB was transfected into LoVo cells, and proliferation, apoptosis and invasion of transfected cells were examined using MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide], flow cytometry and Transwell assays, respectively. Our results showed that TrkB was up-regulated in colon tumors compared with the non-tumorous counterparts, and the overexpression of TrkB was closely correlated with lymphatic vessel density (LVD) and metastasis. Inhibition of TrkB by siRNA increased the apoptotic rates of transfected cells, while the numbers of proliferative and invasive cells were decreased. In summary, our data suggest that overexpression of TrkB in colon cancer possibly plays roles in inhibiting apoptosis, promoting proliferation and invasion, facilitating tumor progression by lymphangiogenesis-associated metastasis.",Colon_Cancer
"Lung cancer is the most frequently occurring cancer in the world and continually leads in mortality among cancers. The overall 5-year survival rate for lung cancer has risen only 4% (from 12% to 16%) over the past 4 decades, and late diagnosis is a major obstacle in improving lung cancer prognosis. Survival of patients undergoing lung resection is greater than 80%, suggesting that early detection and diagnosis of cancers before they become inoperable and lethal will greatly improve mortality. Lung cancer biomarkers can be used for screening, detection, diagnosis, prognosis, prediction, stratification, therapy response monitoring, and so on. This review focuses on noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. For that purpose, our discussion in this review will focus on biological fluid-based biomarkers. The body fluids include blood (serum or plasma), sputum, saliva, BAL, pleural effusion, and VOC. Since it is rich in different cellular and molecular elements and is one of the most convenient and routine clinical procedures, serum or plasma is the main source for the development and validation of many noninvasive biomarkers. In terms of molecular aspects, the most widely validated ones are proteins, some of which are used in the clinical sector, though in limited accessory purposes. We will also discuss the lung cancer (protein) biomarkers in clinical trials and currently in the validation phase with hundreds of samples. After proteins, we will discuss microRNAs, methylated DNA, and circulating tumor cells, which are being vigorously developed and validated as potential lung cancer biomarkers. The main aim of this review is to provide researchers and clinicians with an understanding of the potential noninvasive lung cancer biomarkers in biological fluids that have recently been discovered.",Lung_Cancer
"Because chemotherapy is standard in the treatment of colorectal cancer, it is important to demonstrate whether immunizations may be given to patients receiving systemic chemotherapy. Although some studies have demonstrated immune responses in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who failed standard chemotherapy, the setting of minimal residual disease may be the preferred setting for cancer vaccines. It may be important to choose antigens that have functions important to the cancer cell. The best adjuvant is not well established and may depend on the type of immune response desired. The immune system is ""programmed"" to down-regulate immune responses once they have become activated to avoid the development of autoimmune disease.",Colon_Cancer
"The histone deacetylase (HDAC) family of transcriptional co-repressors have emerged as important regulators of colon cell maturation and transformation. Pharmacological inhibitors of class I and II HDAC activity (HDACi) are potent inducers of growth arrest, differentiation and apoptosis of colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, implicating a role for these HDACs in tumor promotion. Consistent with this role, expression of several HDACs are upregulated in colon tumors, while downregulation of specific HDACs inhibits growth of colon cancer cells in vitro and intestinal tumorigenesis in vivo. This review focuses on the function and transcriptional mechanisms by which class I and II HDACs regulate colon cell maturation and transformation, and on the mechanisms by which HDACi induce growth arrest, differentiation and apoptosis of colon cancer cells. The emerging role of the class III HDAC, Sirt1, in colon cancer progression is also discussed.",Colon_Cancer
"The last decade has seen remarkable success in clinical targeting of activated oncogenes in cancer. We have applied gene expression profiling, high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, and systematic resequencing of genes to identify novel oncogenes and signaling pathways in lung cancer that might represent therapeutic targets. Systematic resequencing of tyrosine kinase genes has led to the discovery of somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in lung adenocarcinomas. These mutations range in frequency from 10% in Caucasian to 40% in East Asian patients. Lung cancer-derived EGFR mutations are oncogenic and are tightly associated with clinical response to the EGFR kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib. Furthermore, gene expression profiling has been shown to classify patients according to their clinical outcome, indicating that the application of this technique may help in guiding patient selection for therapy in the future. Finally, genome-wide analyses of copy number gains and losses were successfully applied to detect gene amplifications and deletions. Taken together, the application of genomics technologies has led to important discoveries with clinical implications in lung cancer that might help to improve clinical care for patients suffering from this highly fatal tumor.",Lung_Cancer
"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, small non-coding RNAs (20-22 nucleotides) that negatively regulate gene expression at the translational level by base pairing to the 3' untranslated region of target messenger RNAs. More than 400 miRNAs have been identified in humans and are evolutionally conserved from plants to animals. It has been revealed that miRNAs regulate various biological processes, such as development, cell differentiation, cell proliferation, and cell death. It is predicted that 30% of protein-encoding genes are regulated by miRNAs. Inappropriate expression of miRNAs has been found in cancer. Especially, the expression level of miRNAs that act like anti-oncogenes is frequently reduced in cancers because of chromosome aberrations. In addition, since the processing of miRNAs has been characterized to be enzymatic in nature, the expression levels of miRNAs are closely associated with the activity and levels of such enzymes. In this review, we discuss recent remarkable advances in miRNA biogenesis, bio-networking involving miRNAs, and their roles in carcinogenesis. Further, we discuss the expression of miRNA-143 and -145 in colon cancer and their roles in carcinogenesis. The available data suggest that miRNAs would be potentially useful as diagnostic and therapeutic tools.",Colon_Cancer

"Twenty patients with lung cancer have undergone bronchoplastic procedures September, 1965, to June, 1976 in our hospital. Bronchoplastic procedures are considered to be indicated for early cases of hilar lung cancer rather than for somewhat advanced cases. Endoscopic examination and roentgenograms of the bronchial arteries are needed to delineate resectional lines of bronchus, the former for deciding the mucosal extent and the latter the intrabronchial extent of the tumor. The bronchoplastic procedures we adopted were free from the risks and dangers generally accompanying the operation, and there were no postoperative deaths. For the prevention of postoperative complications, careful attention to suture technique is needed, and postoperative bronchoscopic suction of intrabronchial secretions is absolutely necessary. These procedures assure good quality of life postoperatively and improvement in the survival rate by preserving pulmonary function, enhancing curability, and increasing the operative indications. These advantages warrant high evaluation of the operation.",Lung_Cancer

"Lung cancer management that is individualized for age, comorbidities, cancer type, cancer stage, and patient preference has long been a cornerstone of management. New to this realm of individualized management are the emerging biologic therapies, immunotherapies, and targeted therapies for non-small-cell lung cancer provided by advances in genetics and molecular medicine. These techniques have led to a new field of precision medicine based on the unique molecular characteristics of a specific patient and the specific cancer. However, standard management including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy remains the most common management options for stage I through III lung cancers. Advancements in precision medicine are most relevant to patients with stage IV (ie, metastatic) lung cancers. Functional patient assessment and pulmonary function testing are keys to preoperative assessment. Early palliative care and a minimally invasive approach to surgery should be considered in patients who can tolerate surgery.",Lung_Cancer
"Patients with differentiated thyroid cancer generally have a good prognosis and high cure rates; however, subgroups of patients exist who develop progressive disease with significant morbidity and mortality. We analyzed the clinical outcome of patients with follicular thyroid cancer and distant metastases to define their presentation, impact of therapy and clinical outcome. A group of 44 patients with follicular thyroid cancer which had metastasized to the lungs or the skeleton was identified. All patients were treated at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1965 and 1994. The group included 26 women and 18 men, with a median age of 56 years (range, 23 to 80 years). The primary tumor was limited to the thyroid in most cases. At the time of writing 13 patients were alive with metastatic disease a median of 43 months (range, 4 to 230 months) after diagnosis, while 27 patients died of thyroid cancer a median of 83 months (range, 4 to 238 months) after diagnosis. Bone pain was the chief complaint in almost all the 24 patients in whom distant metastases were present at diagnosis. In the 20 patients who initially presented with localized disease, distant metastases to the skeleton and/or lungs were detected after a median interval of 53 months (range, 8 to 216 months). Symptomatic spinal cord compression occurred in 13 patients and preceded their death by 4 to 34 months. Radioiodine uptake was seen in most bone metastases but in only about half of metastatic foci in the lungs. Radiotherapy was palliative and useful for bone metastases. We conclude that patients with follicular thyroid cancer and distant metastases have a distinct clinical profile that includes prominent skeletal and pulmonary involvement and substantial morbidity and mortality. Intensive multimodality therapy is required to optimize the clinical outcome.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Green financial policy is one of the important policy tools for China to implement the national carbon peak goal and carbon neutral vision through financial means. This policy has an important impact on the business strategy of corporates. Based on the data of listed corporates from 2013 to 2020, this study examines the impact mechanism of China's green financial reform and innovation pilot zones (GFRIPZ) on corporate financialization (CF) using the difference-in-difference method. The results show the following: (1) The implementation of GFRIPZ significantly restrains the CF. (2) GFRIPZ reversed the short-sighted behavior of firms and guided them to accelerate the green transformation and upgrading for long-term development. Firms' environmental capital expenditure and research and development expenditure increased significantly. (3) The restraining effect of GFRIPZ on CF is stronger in state-owned firms, firms with low-degree managerial myopia, and high-polluting firms. The research clearly identifies the causal relationship and mechanism between GFRIPZ and CF and reveals the formation mechanism and solution path of CF from the green finance perspective. In addition, this study has implications for guiding the green transformation of entity firms and stopping firms from deviating from their intended purpose.",Generic
"Plasmonic nanomaterials have outstanding optoelectronic properties potentially enabling the next generation of catalysts, sensors, lasers and photothermal devices. Owing to optical and electron techniques, modern nanoplasmonics research generates large datasets characterizing features across length scales. Furthermore, optimizing syntheses leading to specific nanostructures requires time-consuming multiparametric approaches. These complex datasets and trial-and-error practices make nanoplasmonics research ripe for the application of machine learning (ML) and advanced data processing methods. ML algorithms capture relationships between synthesis, structure and performance in a way that far exceeds conventional simulation and theory approaches, enabling effective performance optimization. For example, neural networks can tailor the nanostructure morphology to target desired properties, identify synthetic conditions and extract quantitative information from complex data. Here we discuss the nascent field of ML for nanoplasmonics, describe the opportunities and limitations of ML in nanoplasmonic research, and conclude that ML is potentially transformative, especially if the community curates and shares its big data.",Generic
"Lung cancers express an autocrine cholinergic loop in which secreted acetylcholine can stimulate tumor growth through both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. Because activation of mAChR and nAChR stimulates growth; tumor growth can be stimulated by both locally synthesized acetylcholine as well as acetylcholine from distal sources and from nicotine in the high percentage of lung cancer patients who are smokers. The stimulation of lung cancer growth by cholinergic agonists offers many potential new targets for lung cancer therapy. Cholinergic signaling can be targeted at the level of choline transport; acetylcholine synthesis, secretion and degradation; and nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. In addition, the newly describe family of ly-6 allosteric modulators of nicotinic signaling such as lynx1 and lynx2 offers yet another new approach to novel lung cancer therapeutics. Each of these targets has their potential advantages and disadvantages for the development of new lung cancer therapies which are discussed in this review.",Lung_Cancer
"Based on several landmark studies and meta-analyses, the standard of care for stage II - III A NSCLC patients has been adjuvant cisplatin-based doublet chemotherapy performed after appropriate surgical resection. The benefit of this therapy for patients with stage I B NSCLC is less apparent, likely because of the heterogeneity of this population. In Japan, however, many randomized clinical studies have assessed the effectiveness of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with tegafur-uracil (UFT)in patients with completely resected NSCLC. Based on these studies and a meta-analysis, UFT is used as the standard postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for stage I NSCLC patients with a tumor larger than 2 cm. It is necessary to re-evaluate adjuvant chemotherapy strategies according to the new seventh edition of the tumor-nodemetastasis classification system. The role of postoperative radiotherapy(PORT)is also explored there. Recently, several tumor markers such as ERCC1 may have had a predictive value for selecting patients who will benefit from adjuvant platin-based chemotherapy. Targeted agents and vaccine therapy are also being evaluated as adjuvant treatments for use after the resection of NSCLC. Randomized studies are ongoing. If these results are confirmed, we will enter an era of personalized care for resected NSCLC.",Lung_Cancer

"The acquisition of genomic instability is a crucial feature in tumor development and there are at least 3 distinct pathways in colorectal cancer pathogenesis: the chromosomal instability (CIN), microsatellite instability, and CpG island methylator phenotype pathways. Most cases of colorectal cancer arise through the CIN pathway, which is characterized by widespread imbalances in chromosome number (aneuploidy) and loss of heterozygosity. It can result from defects in chromosomal segregation, telomere stability, and the DNA damage response, although the full complement of genes underlying CIN remains incompletely described. Coupled with the karyotypic abnormalities observed in CIN tumors are the accumulation of a characteristic set of mutations in specific tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes that activate pathways critical for colorectal cancer initiation and progression. Whether CIN creates the appropriate milieu for the accumulation of these mutations or vice versa remains a provocative and unanswered question. The goal of this review is to provide an updated perspective on the mechanisms that lead to CIN and the key mutations that are acquired in this pathway.",Colon_Cancer

"Thirty-five patients who died of differentiated thyroid cancer were analyzed for factors affecting survival. The neck was the most common initial site of recurrence (62.0%). The lung was the most common metastatic site (56.7%). Major sites associated with death were locoregional recurrence (neck and mediastinum: 48.6%) and bone metastases (22.9%). By univariate analysis, local tumor extension, type of initial surgery, and residual tumor and/or existence of distant metastases at the initial operation were significant factors affecting survival. Stepwise multivariate analysis revealed that invasion of the esophagus and/or carotid artery shortened survival and that multiple surgeries extended survival. Our results suggest that to improve survival in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, better locoregional control, including multiple surgical resection, is necessary.",Thyroid_Cancer

With the first immunomodulating agents having been approved for treatment of selected lung cancer patients, there are high expectations that treatment outcomes may be improved with the incorporation of immunotherapies into the various treatment cascades.",Lung_Cancer
"As with other epithelial cancers, lung cancer develops over a period of several years or decades via a series of progressive morphological changes accompanied by molecular alterations that commence in histologically normal epithelium. However the development of lung cancer presents certain unique features that complicates this evaluation. Anatomically the respiratory tree may be divided into central and peripheral compartments having different gross and histological anatomies as well as different functions. In addition, there are three major forms of lung cancer and many minor forms. Many of these forms arise predominantly in either the central or peripheral compartments. Squamous cell and small cell carcinomas predominantly arise in the central compartment, while adenocarcinomas predominantly arise peripherally. Large cell carcinomas are not a single entity but consist of poorly differentiated forms of the other types and, possibly, some truly undifferentiated ""stem cell like"" tumors. The multistage origin of squamous cell carcinomas, because of their central location, can be followed more closely than the peripherally arising adenocarcinomas. Squamous cell carcinomas arise after a series of reactive, metaplastic, premalignant and preinvasive changes. However, long term observations indicate that not all tumors follow a defined histologic course, and the clinical course, especially of early lesions, is difficult to predict. Peripheral adenocarcinomas are believed to arise from precursor lesions known as atypical adenomatous hyperplasias and may have extensive in situ growth before becoming invasive. Small cell carcinomas are believed to arise from severely molecularly damaged epithelium without going through recognizable preneoplastic changes. The molecular changes that occur prior to the onset on invasive cancers are extensive. As documented in this chapter, they encompass all of the six classic Hallmarks of Cancer other than invasion and metastasis, which by definition occur beyond preneoplasia. A study of preinvasive lung cancer has yielded much valuable biologic information that impacts on clinical management.",Lung_Cancer

"Colon cancer is still the second most frequent malignancy in the Western world. Despite major efforts in diagnosis and treatment it is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths. The metastatic dissemination of primary tumors is directly linked to patient's survival and accounts for about 90% of all colon cancer deaths. Current clinical predictions on whether colon cancer will metastasize are mainly defined by histopathological staging, describing the tumor spread within a surgical specimen. This review focuses on the need for molecule-based staging as essential prerequisite for individualized diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. Molecular determinants for progression and metastasis of colon cancer are discussed. Moreover, a newly identified molecule playing a decisive role in colon cancer metastasis is highlighted: MACC1. MACC1 acts as a key regulator of the metastasis-inducing HGF/Met pathway, predicts the risk for metastasis in early cancer stages, and represents a novel target to attack metastasis.",Colon_Cancer

"Sphingolipids were first described more than 100 years ago by the physician Thudicum who named the fatty substance he found in brain, sphingosin. Among multiple other functions, sphingolipids are lipid messengers in the signaling pathways of growth factors, cytokines, cellular stresses and others. As such, they are involved in the regulation of a wide spectrum of processes that modulate cell growth and cell death. These functions may be beneficial in cancer cells that escape growth regulation and exhibit unlimited proliferation. The effects of exogenous sphingolipids on cancer cells in vitro have been well documented; however, the effects of sphingolipids in vivo are less well understood. Since the mechanisms sphingolipids utilize in the prevention of cancer may be different from those in cancer treatment, modulation of cell growth versus induction of cell death, this review will focus on the known effects of orally administered sphingolipids in the prevention of colon cancer in different rodent models, and discuss the effect of sphingolipid metabolites on changes in cell proliferation and cell death that are important events in early carcinogenesis.",Colon_Cancer
"The primary curative therapy of colorectal cancer is surgical resection. However, within the last 15 years, prospectively randomized appropriately powered clinical trials have convincingly demonstrated that adjunctive postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is of benefit to all patients with node-positive disease (stage III) and arguably to high-risk node-negative (stage II) cases. In the United States, the clinical trials encompassing greater than 5,000 cases have demonstrated that fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin used in a variety of doses and schedules improves disease-free and overall survival in resected node-positive (stage III) colorectal cancer. The postoperative use of 5-FU/leucovorin for approximately 6 months represents standard of care for such patients. Current clinical trials are evaluating the role of nonfluorinated pyrimidine chemotherapeutic agents in adjuvant chemotherapy for resected large bowel cancer. 5-FU/leucovorin combined with irinotecan (CPT-11) versus 5-FU/leucovorin are being tested in a national intergroup clinical trial. Another trial is evaluating 5-FU/leucovorin plus oxaliplatin versus 5-FU/leucovorin alone. These clinical trials will be important in defining the appropriate standard of care for patients with resected colorectal cancer, since recent studies in advanced colorectal cancer in the United States and in Western Europe have demonstrated that combinations of 5-FU/leucovorin and CPT-11 or 5-FU/ leucovorin and oxaliplatin are superior to 5-FU/leucovorin alone.",Colon_Cancer

The prognostic characteristics are based on 117 patients with MTC diagnosed in Denmark between 1970-1991. Twenty percent of all MTC patients were members of families with two or more thyroid cancer patients. More than half of all MTC patients had neck lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis. The frequency of neck lymph node involvement was however only 20% amongst those with familiar MTC.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Sera from 71 patients with localized lung cancer, from 70 normal controls, and from 73 patients with benign lung diseases were analyzed for 10 substances to detect lung cancer: ferritin, lipid-bound sialic acid, total sialic acid, beta 2-microglobulin, lipotropin, the alpha and beta subunits of human chorionic gonadotropin, calcitonin (two assays), parathyroid hormone, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Individual markers were studied, and optimal combinations of markers were sought for discriminating patients with localized lung cancer from normal controls and from patients with benign lung disease. Both logistic regression and recursive partitioning methods for discrimination were tried. The best rules involved only CEA and ferritin for discriminating patients with lung cancer from normal controls, and CEA and age for discriminating patients with lung cancer from those with benign lung diseases. The performance of these rules was validated on an independent serum panel containing sera from 56 patients with localized lung cancer, 75 normal controls, and 75 patients with benign lung diseases. Three rules designed to achieve 95% specificity against normal controls attained 14%-36% sensitivity for localized lung cancer in the validation panels, whereas three rules designed to achieve 95% specificity against benign lung diseases attained 30%-39% sensitivity. Some aspects of potential clinical applications are discussed.",Lung_Cancer
"Personalized lung cancer therapy has progressed by targeting several oncogenic aberrations that drive lung carcinogenesis. Recent advances in gene analysis technologies, including next-generation sequencing that yields large amounts of genomic data, have greatly contributed to this progress. In addition, immune checkpoint blockade therapy has become available in Japan, and extensive searches for biomarkers predictive of therapeutic response have been carried out. ""Clinical sequencing"" which analyzes aberrations in a set of therapy-related genes in patient cancer specimens, has been actively conducted in Japan and other countries. This will help to establish more efficient and effective precision cancer medicine based on gene information. Herein, we summarize the recent progress in personalized lung cancer therapy research, including clinical sequencing.",Lung_Cancer
"Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine cancer in adults with rising incidence. Challenges in imaging thyroid cancer are twofold: distinguishing thyroid cancer from benign thyroid nodules, which occur in 50% of the population over 50 years; and correct staging of thyroid cancer to facilitate appropriate radical surgery in a single session. The clinical management of thyroid cancer patients has been covered in detail by the 2015 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association (ATA).

"Differentiated thyroid tumours of follicular cell derivation have traditionally been classified based on architecture, cytology, or both. The features that distinguish the various entities are controversial and diagnostic criteria are inconsistent and often irreproducible. The complexity of classification schemes has not been substantiated by molecular profiling. In this review, a simplistic approach to the diagnosis of well differentiated thyroid neoplasia is provided to challenge the dogma. The proposed classification matches the molecular profiles of these lesions and simplifies the criteria for diagnosis. This approach can be used to support rational treatment algorithms.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The most dramatic effect of exposure to fallout from the Chernobyl accident on physical health has been the increase in thyroid cancer. When this was first reported 1,2, there was scepticism in Europe and the US, as it was not thought plausible that exposure to radio-isotopes of iodine in fallout could lead to such an increase in thyroid cancer with such a short latency. This review will discuss the lessons to be learnt from a re-examination of the reasons for the original scepticism, together with what is currently known about the factors that have influenced the development of excess thyroid cancers in those exposed, the number and type of cancers that have occurred, and the interaction between tumor morphology, molecular pathology, clinical behavior, and latent period.",Thyroid_Cancer
"There is considerable interest in the involvement of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in colon carcinogenesis and its progression, because nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce mortality from colon cancer and COX-2 is one of the known targets of NSAIDs. COX-2 mRNA and protein levels are increased in colon cancer tissues from patients and in some colon cancer cell lines. The relationship between COX-2 and colon cancer is further confirmed by studies using the murine models of adenomatous polyposis coli, in which NSAIDs and gene knockouts reduce the number of spontaneously developing intestinal polyps. COX-2 expression in intestinal epithelial cells increases resistance to apoptosis, promotes tumor angiogenesis, and enhances invasion and metastasis. COX-2 expression in stromal cells appears to have a role in tumor angiogenesis because tumor growth is attenuated when colon cancer cells are implanted in COX-2 knockout mice due to a decreased vascular supply to the tumors. Although NSAIDs act via COX-2 to inhibit colon cancer growth, there also appear to be COX-2 independent actions for NSAIDs. COX-2 selective inhibitors can be the core drugs for the prevention and the treatment of colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer

"Over the last four decades, methodological innovations have continuously changed transcriptome profiling. It is now feasible to sequence and quantify the transcriptional outputs of individual cells or thousands of samples using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). These transcriptomes serve as a connection between cellular behaviors and their underlying molecular mechanisms, such as mutations. This relationship, in the context of cancer, provides a chance to unravel tumor complexity and heterogeneity and uncover novel biomarkers or treatment options. Since colon cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies, its prognosis and diagnosis seem to be critical. The transcriptome technology is developing for an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of cancer which can provide better protectivity and prognostic utility to medical teams and patients. A transcriptome is a whole set of expressed coding and non-coding RNAs in an individual or cell population. The cancer transcriptome includes RNA-based changes. The combined genome and transcriptome of a patient may provide a comprehensive picture of their cancer, and this information is beginning to affect treatment decision-making in real-time. A full assessment of the transcriptome of colon (colorectal) cancer has been assessed in this review paper based on risk factors such as age, obesity, gender, alcohol use, race, and also different stages of cancer, as well as non-coding RNAs like circRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and siRNAs. Similarly, they have been examined independently in the transcriptome study of colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Biotechnology could provide many innovative alternatives for changing the way metals are obtained. Microbes have been used to dissolve metallic minerals and release metal ions into solution, from which pure metal can be obtained by electrolysis. Plants that accumulate metals in their roots and leaves have been used to concentrate metals, and mineral-binding peptides might be used to separate minerals. However, for billions of years microbes have been interacting with metals. Microbial communities in and near mineral sources are therefore a rich source of genetic information which could be used to create synthetic or modified microbiomes that concentrate metals. This would be a complete paradigm-change with enormous scope for transforming the way metals are obtained.",Generic
"Studies in humans and animals have suggested that the distribution of histologic types of radio-induced thyroid cancers is different from that of naturally occurring tumors. In an attempt to verify that finding, histologic results of 31 patients with thyroid cancer, who had received irradiation to the head, neck or upper chest for other causes, were compared with those of 389 non irradiated patients. The two groups were homogeneous for age and sex. There was a significantly higher prevalence of the papillary type in the irradiated group, with an higher incidence of metastatic lymph nodes. Other histopathologic findings, coexisting with the papillary carcinoma (i.e., ground glass subtype, size less than 1.5 cm, multicentricity) did not differ significantly in the two groups.

"Among 14 patients with carcinoma of the lung and scleroderma, 9 had no history of smoking. The 14 cases of primary lung carcinoma occurred in a population of 3550 patients with a diagnosis of scleroderma. Scleroderma preceded the diagnosis of lung cancer by at least 6 years in 8 cases. Scleroderma and lung carcinoma were diagnosed within 3 years of each other in 4 cases. The most frequent type of carcinoma in our series was small cell carcinoma, which accounted for 5 of the 14 cases. Our data indicate an increased risk of carcinoma of the lung in patients with scleroderma, even among nonsmokers. Small cell carcinoma of the lung is probably much more common in patients with scleroderma in whom lung carcinoma develops than is indicated by previous reports.",Lung_Cancer
"This review examines some of the evidence regarding probiotic bacteria as agents to reduce the risk of colon cancer in humans. While some of the evidence using rodent models of colon cancer is convincing for a reduction in cancer incidence and burden with the introduction orally of such bacteria as Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and gg, convincing evidence in humans is more difficult to find. It consists of epidemiological studies or marker intervention studies using faecal enzymes, faecal bile acids or urinary/ faecal mutagens from microbial activity as measures of cancer risk, following probiotic introduction. Taken together these sources of data provide limited support for the hypothesis that probiotic bacteria are effective in cancer prevention.",Colon_Cancer
"One hundred and seventeen patients with thyroid cancer were seen at the Radiotherapy and Isotope Centre, Al-Sabah Hospital, Kuwait, between 1963 and 1974. Thyroid cancer constituted 4.7 per cent of all cancer cases among females and 2.4 per cent among males. Of these carcinomas, 58 per cent were papillary, 25 per cent follicular, 11 per cent anaplastic and 1.7 per cent medullary. Four cases (3.4 per cent) were of malignant lymphoma. The 10-year survival was 74, 96 and 21 per cent for papillary, follicular and anaplastic tumours respectively. The present series confirms the prognostic value of age, sex and histology and shows that node metastasis does not prejudice survival. The study does not show any correlation between the type of operation and survival.",Thyroid_Cancer

"p68 is an interferon-inducible protein kinase which is a key factor in the regulation of both viral and cellular protein synthesis. Since p68 plays a central role in cellular protein synthesis, we hypothesized that it would parallel translational activity, and thereby correlate with cellular differentiation in both normal and neoplastic cell types. Using the anti-p68 monoclonal antibody, TJ4C4, we have previously noted a correlation of p68 expression with the degree of cellular differentiation in the human upper aerodigestive tract and lung. During normal human fetal development, p68 is abundantly expressed in the upper aerodigestive tract and lungs, but considerably less so in the colon. In order to determine if this fetal expression pattern correlated with the pattern seen in adult colon and colonic adenocarcinomas, we analyzed the expression pattern of p68 in 80 patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon. Using light microscopic evaluation of immunoperoxidase-stained tissue sections, a spectrum of p68 expression was noted among the tissue samples. Increased p68 levels were noted in the majority of tumors with increased cellular differentiation, and those tissues with decreased p68 were, in general, less differentiated. These data are consistent with the concept that the expression of p68 parallels the degree of cellular differentiation, and are consistent with previously reported studies using this antibody. The limited fetal expression pattern of p68 in the colon and the variable correlation of p68 with differentiation suggests that p68, as well as other translational regulators, can be important in assessing the biological potential of tumors arising in the colon.",Colon_Cancer
"The treatment of colon cancer is a significant source of malpractice liability. Physicians are justifiably concerned about malpractice exposure as personal injury attorneys investigate standard and novel malpractice theories and claims. With the general acceptance of the importance of screening for colon cancer, screening for colon cancer is now defined as the standard of care. This has opened up a previously neglected area of malpractice liability. Physicians need to understand the sources of malpractice risk and risk-management strategies related to these sources to reduce their exposure to liability suits in this area. This article outlines these sources evolving from the tort of negligence, including the duty to provide care, practicing below the standards of care, the cause of the harm, and the actual establishment of harm.

"Tryptophan is one of the eight essential amino acids that must be obtained from the diet. Interestingly, tryptophan is the least abundant amino acid in most proteins, a large portion of cellular tryptophan is converted into metabolites of the serotonin and kynurenine pathways. In a recent study, (Venkateswaran, Lafita-Navarro et al., 2019, Genes Dev), we discovered that colon cancer cells display greater uptake and processing of tryptophan than normal colonic cells and tissues. This process is mediated by the oncogenic transcription factor MYC that promotes the expression of the tryptophan importers SLC1A5 and SLC7A5 and the tryptophan metabolizing enzyme AFMID. The metabolism of tryptophan in colon cancer cells generates kynurenine, a biologically active metabolite necessary to maintain continuous cell proliferation. Our results indicate that kynurenine functions as an oncometabolite, at least in part, by activating the transcription factor AHR, which then regulates growth promoting genes in cancer cells. We propose that blocking kynurenine production or activity can be an efficient approach to specifically limit the growth of colon cancer cells. Here, we describe our findings and new questions for future studies targeted at understanding AHR-independent function of kynurenine, as well as interfering with the enzyme AFMID as a new strategy to target the kynurenine pathway.",Colon_Cancer
"Despite advances in research and treatment modalities, colorectal cancer still accounts for around half a million deaths yearly worldwide. Traditional and even newer pharmaceutical therapeutic regimens are limited in terms of tolerance, efficacy and cross-resistance. Additional non-cross resistant therapies with non-overlapping toxicities are needed to improve the outcome for patients with colorectal cancer. Cancer vaccines, designed to activate immune effectors (T-cells and antibodies) to prevent recurrence or treat advanced cancers, have now demonstrated clinical benefit in prostate cancer and lymphoma. Because immune effector infiltration into colon tumours is associated with improved clinical outcome, vaccines intended to activate immune responses against colon cancer have generated significant interest. This review discusses data supportive of the immune responsiveness of colorectal cancer, as well as the current status of colon cancer vaccines under development including those based on whole tumour cells or lysates, peptide or protein antigens, anti-idiotype antibodies, viral vectors, and dendritic cells.

"The main purpose of tumor classification is to distinguish clear differences such as deciding treatment or showing a peculiar characteristic. In the treatment of lung cancer, the standard for treatment selection is to make the important classification of small cell lung cancer(SCLC)and non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC). This is based on the fact that with a clinical-pathology difference and treatment reactivity, the prognosis differs between SCLC and NSCLC. In the 21st century, it has become insufficient to choose a treatment only by the classification of NSCLC with the advent of gefitinib a molecular target drug. Thus, treatment must be chosen in terms of the presence or absence of adenocarcinoma, an ethnic group, gender, a smoking history, and also the gene mutation. Moreover, it was reported by ASCO in 2008 that efficacy of pemetrexed is low for non-squamous cell carcinoma. From now on, not the NSCLC classification, but further detailed classification is needed to choose a treatment.

"The paper is aimed at approaching radiation therapy methods to physicians of other specialties and pointing to the potential of radiation therapy in the management of lung cancer patients. With the reference to its incidence and mortality rates, lung cancer ranks among the most frequent human malignant tumors. Therapy procedures for lung cancer depend upon tumor histology type, stage of disease and patient general condition. The said parameters therefore determine the application of surgery, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. In general, treatment results are usually rather poor, primarily due to lung cancer being the most frequently detected only as locally advanced or metastatic disease. Alike surgery, radiotherapy is a local form of treatment aimed at achieving local tumor control. This curative or palliative form of treatment is either applied alone or in combination with other treatment modalities. Irradiation is usually delivered by high energy photon beams from a telecobalt device or linear accelerator. The success of radiation therapy complies with the irradiation dose managed to be applied to tumor or tumor bed, which depends on patients general condition and site, size and spread of tumor. Radiotherapy with curative intent is applied in stage I, II and III non-small cell lung cancer patients with surgery being primarily applied in those with stage I and II. The efficacy of surgical treatment is to be improved by a combined-modality treatment. In stage III patients, who are more frequent than others, radical radiotherapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy is applied. Results of clinical trials report patients of relatively good general condition benefiting from combined-modality therapy. Palliative radiotherapy is to be applied in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. On the other hand, in patients with small cell lung cancer chemotherapy is the primary modality treatment. When the disease is limited to the lungs, the aim of radiotherapy is to optimize local control of the primary tumor.",Lung_Cancer

Moreover, patients in both surgical groups were discharged after similar length hospital stays although patients undergoing VATS segmentectomy had worse pulmonary function before surgery. Perceived difficulties with new applications of minimally invasive surgeries disappear as experience increases, permitting application to technically more challenging operations.

"Using the Cancer-Environment Registry of Sweden, which links census information (1960) with cancer incidence data (1961 to 1979), we conducted a systematic, population-based assessment of colon cancer incidence among cohorts defined by industry and occupation for all employed persons in Sweden. Small but statistically significant excesses of colon cancer were observed among white-collar occupations, including administrators, professionals, and clerical and sales workers, whereas a reduction in incidence was found among workers in agricultural and related jobs, such as farmers, fishermen, and hunters. Analysis by subsite within the colon revealed little difference in results. The observed risk patterns are consistent with previous reports on colon cancer risk and occupational physical activity levels, ie, elevated risk among sedentary white-collar workers and reduced risk among agricultural workers. Few craftsman and production processing jobs were linked to colon cancer, although statistically significant excesses were observed among shoe and leather workers, metal smiths, and foundry workers in the metal manufacturing industry. The findings indicate that occupation in general is likely to play a relatively small role in colon cancer etiology, with perhaps its major contribution an indirect one via physical activity.",Colon_Cancer
"Circulating immune complexes (CIC) were found in 47% of 71 patients before treatment, in a horizontal study of the presence of CIC in primary lung cancer (PLC). The precipitation technique in PEG was used, and C1q, IgG and IgM fractions in the precipitate were assayed. Especially in epidermoid carcinoma, CIC were found in 1/6 cases with stage 1, 2/9 with stage II and 21/34 with stage III. The frequency was significantly higher in stage III cases, and showed a significant tendency to increase with progression of the clinical stage. If stage parameters are considered separately, this tendency correlates significantly (p less than 0.002) with the amount of lymph node involvement (N) but not to the tumor (T) size nor to the presence of metastases (M). Analysis of CIC behavior in comparison with the single fractions showed that C1q and/or IgG were elevated in 40% of cases. The presence of C1q and/or IgG associated with IgM is more characteristic of stage N2, while the presence of CIC with the fractions C1q and/or IgG not associated with IgM is more frequent in stage N1. There was a lower survival rate at 12 months in patients with CIC as compared to those without (p less than 0.05).",Lung_Cancer

"There are abundant experimental and clinical data to associate radiation exposure and thyroid cancer. The incidence of thyroid cancer increases with increasing doses of thyroidal radiation from 6.5 rads to 1,500 rads, but higher doses tend to destroy the gland and are associated with hypothyroidism rather than cancer. The peak occurrence of thyroid tumors is between five and 30 years after exposure, but a person may develop thyroid tumors as long as 50 years after irradiation. Multiple thyroidal lesions or disorders, including adenomas, thyroditis, and hypothyroidism as well as malignant neoplasms, can occur after radiation exposure. It is imperative, therefore, to study carefully all patients with a history of radiation exposure to the gland and to observe them carefully for life.

"Differentiated thyroid cancer comprises papillary, mixed papillary-follicular and follicular adenocarcinomas. They are mostly hormone-sensitive and respond to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression. The standard treatment is total thyroidectomy, (131)I therapy and thyroid hormone suppression therapy. Adjuvant external radiotherapy is discussed controversially. Most authors recommend adjuvant external radiotherapy for extra-capsular tumor extension. Decision on an individual basis should be made for patients with lymph node involvement. In the case of incomplete surgical resection, external radiotherapy should be applied if second surgery is not possible. For medullary thyroid cancer, external beam radiotherapy seems to be beneficial for patients with surgically inaccessible disease, with microscopic residual or gross tumor after surgery, with recurrent locoregional disease, or with surgically unmanageable metastases. Patients suffering from anaplastic thyroid cancer should receive combined treatment consisting of extensive surgery, external irradiation with total doses up to 60 Gy, and chemotherapy.

"Thyroid cancer harbours in about 5% of thyroid nodules. The majority of them are well-differentiated cancers originating from the follicular epithelium, and are subdivided into papillary and follicular carcinomas. Undifferentiated carcinomas and medullary thyroid carcinomas arising from C cells are less common.Although most thyroid nodules are benign, distinguishing thyroid cancer from benign lesions is crucial for an appropriate treatment and follow-up. The fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) allows the diagnosis of nature of thyroid nodules in the majority of cases. However, FNAC has some limitations, particularly in the presence of follicular lesions which can appear dubious in rare instances even at histology.In an effort to improve diagnostic accuracy and offer new prognostic criteria, several immunohistochemical and molecular markers have been proposed. However, most of them have to be validated on large series before being used in routine practice.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Follicular thyroid cancer is the second most common thyroid malignancy after PTC. There are marked geographical variations in the relative proportions of FTC and PTC, most likely related to dietary iodine content. In iodine-deficient areas, the relative rate of FTC tends to be increased. Other risk factors for FTC include age over 50 years and female sex. Genetic factors may also have a role in determining disease susceptibility but remain ill-defined. Histologically, FTC is characterized by follicle formation and the absence of any papillary elements in the tumor. Differential diagnosis from a benign adenoma can be difficult. The degree of vascular invasiveness seems to correlate with tumor aggressiveness, and two histologic subtypes, oxyphilic FTC and insular FTC, may be associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Primary treatment for FTC is complete surgical tumor removal. Extensive bilateral surgery beyond this goal may not confer additional benefit but can facilitate adjuvant treatment and follow-up. Postoperative levothyroxine treatment is almost universally used, and patients deemed at high risk of recurrence may benefit from radioiodine remnant ablation. Treatment of metastatic disease involves operation, radioiodine, and, in selected cases, external beam radiation and chemotherapy. Prognosis for patients with metastatic disease is guarded, but most other patients have good outcomes comparable to that in PTC. For nonoxyphilic FTC, high-risk features other than initial metastases include advanced age, locally extensive disease, and the presence of marked angioinvasion. In oxyphilic FTC, DNA aneuploidy is also important. Follow-up should be most intense during the first 5 years after primary treatment and needs to be tailored to the patient's risk of disease progression. For patients at low risk of recurrence (young, small lesions, minimally invasive tumor), serum thyroglobulin measurements may largely suffice, whereas higher risk patients with elevated serum thyroglobulin levels and patients with significant titers of interfering anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies may also need to undergo periodic diagnostic radioiodine scanning.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Three years ago continental guidelines were published referring management and follow-up of low risk thyroid cancer patients. The aim of this paper is to summarize the changes and new directions in this field. High risk patients require another protocol. Neck ultrasound plays important role in differential diagnosis and in detecting recurrences. Some new ultrasound techniques are discussed, too. FDG-PET can help to solve the problem of patients having negative scan and increased thyroglobulin level. In recent years there was an expansion of our knowledge about the pathomechanism of thyroid cancer. It appears that genetic alterations frequently play a key role in carcinogenesis. There are molecular methods that allow the detection of these genetic events in thyroid fine needle aspirations samples providing important information for diagnosis, management and prognosis. Instead of diagnostic whole body scanning the posttherapeutic scan became preferable but in high risk cases the diagnostic whole body scintigrams serve useful data. Primary therapy of thyroid cancer is an adequate surgery: total thyreoidectomy and, if necessary, lymph node dissection or limited surgery in selected cases. Nowadays radioguided surgery can help to improve the results. Radioiodine therapy (e.g. rest ablation) proved to be a safe and effective method to complete surgery. It can prevent relapses and results in longer survival. Thyroid hormone withdrawal or recombinant human thyrotropin stimulation can increase thyrotropin level before radioiodine treatment. These two methods have similar success rate of rest ablation but irradiation burden of blood is lower in the case of exogenous stimulation which avoids hypothyroid state and preserves quality of life. Since tumor cells fail to maintain the ability to perform physiological functions they undergo dedifferentiation. Therefore, an important aim is to reactivate some function of differentiated cells, e.g. iodine uptake, production of thyroperoxydase and thyroglobulin. Opportunities for this therapeutic effort are also mentioned. Restoration of iodine uptake enables radioisotope treatment. Until now there has been little interest in the development of new drugs for the treatment of thyroid cancer. However, advances in our understanding of tumor cell biology will lead to a paradigm shift in the therapy that is likely to benefit patients who have high risk disease and who do not almost have any therapeutic option. There are new drugs in clinical trials that appear to be more effective than earlier cytotoxic agents. Probably modern chemotherapy of advanced thyroid cancer will have significant results in the near future.",Thyroid_Cancer
"A higher incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is found in males compared to females. Young women (18-44 years) with CRC have a better survival outcome compared to men of the same age or compared to older women (over 50 years), indicating a global incidence of sexual dimorphism in CRC rates and survival. This suggests a protective role for the sex steroid hormone estrogen in CRC development. Key proliferative pathways in CRC tumorigenesis exhibit sexual dimorphism, which confer better survival in females through estrogen regulated genes and cell signaling. Estrogen regulates the activity of a class of Kv channels (KCNQ1:KCNE3), which control fundamental ion transport functions of the colon and epithelial mesenchymal transition through bi-directional interactions with the Wnt/ -catenin signalling pathway. Estrogen also modulates CRC proliferative responses in hypoxia via the novel membrane estrogen receptor GPER and HIF1A and VEGF signaling. Here we critically review recent clinical and molecular insights into sexual dimorphism of CRC biology modulated by the tumor microenvironment, estrogen, Wnt/ -catenin signalling, ion channels, and X-linked genes.",Colon_Cancer
"Knowledge-based biomedical data science involves the design and implementation of computer systems that act as if they knew about biomedicine. Such systems depend on formally represented knowledge in computer systems, often in the form of knowledge graphs. Here we survey recent progress in systems that use formally represented knowledge to address data science problems in both clinical and biological domains, as well as progress on approaches for creating knowledge graphs. Major themes include the relationships between knowledge graphs and machine learning, the use of natural language processing to construct knowledge graphs, and the expansion of novel knowledge-based approaches to clinical and biological domains.",Generic

"Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) has one of the lowest cancer mutational burdens, while anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) has a much higher mutation frequency. A fraction of ATC has an associated differentiated component, which suggests the coevolution of both cancers. Here, we aimed to compare mutation frequency in coexisting ATC and DTC diagnosed concurrently in the same thyroid gland (3 cases) as well as in archetypal DTC and ATC alone (5 cases each). Single-nucleotide variations (SNV) and copy number variations (CNV) were analyzed in each case based on the next-generation sequencing data. We found a similar extent of mutational events, both SNV and CNV, in undifferentiated and differentiated components of thyroid cancers coexisting in one patient. The magnitude of these mutations was comparable to the level of mutations observed in ATC alone; yet, it was much higher than in archetypal DTC. This suggested that, despite histopathological features of differentiated tumors, molecular characteristics of such cancers coexisting with ATC and archetypal DTC could be significantly different. Pairwise comparison of mutational profiles of coexisting cancers enabled assumption on the possible evolution of both components, which appeared distinct in 3 analyzed cases. This included independent development of ATC and DTC diagnosed concurrently in two lobes of the same thyroid, as well as the development of anaplastic and differentiated cancer from the common ancestor that putatively gained a key driver mutation (BRAFV600E or KRASQ61R), which was followed either by early or late molecular separation of both cancers.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Lung cancer remains a major cause of mortality worldwide, despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Most patients present with advanced disease, and early detection approaches are still experimental. Chemoprevention strategies are therefore essential. Chemoprevention can be defined as the use of specific natural or synthetic chemical agents to reverse, suppress or prevent progression to invasive cancer. The present review will provide an update on lung cancer clinical chemoprevention trials as well as the molecular basis of lung carcinogenesis. A better knowledge of lung carcinogenesis is obviously fundamental to improve chemoprevention strategies. Identification of molecular defects involved in premalignant lesions and/or invasive cancer could lead to clinical studies with new molecular-targeted agents (mainly tyrosine kinase inhibitors, farnesyl-transferase inhibitors and/or antiangiogenic molecules) and the development of surrogate biomarkers. Such biomarkers would be essential to detect high-risk patients, select adequate chemoprevention strategies and monitor drug efficacy. New chemoprevention trials are planned with collaborative efforts of researchers involved in fundamental or clinical studies.",Lung_Cancer

"Accumulating data suggest that the risks for development of lung cancer are different in women compared with men. An increased susceptibility in women to the adverse effects of tobacco may be due to higher levels of DNA adducts, decreased DNA repair capacity, increased frequency of mutations in tumor suppressor genes, and hormonal differences. There are many sex and gender differences in lung cancer presentation, including a greater proportion of adenocarcinoma among women, a greater representation of women in cohorts of younger patients who have lung cancer, and women who do not smoke are more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than men. When guidelines for screening, preventive therapies, and treatment options for lung cancer are outlined these differences should be considered.",Lung_Cancer

"Lung cancer has a high prevalence and mortality due to its late diagnosis and limited treatment, so it is essential to find biomarkers that allow a faster diagnosis and improve the survival of these patients. In this sense, biomarkers based on miRNAs have supposed a considerable advance. miRNAs, which are small RNA sequences, can regulate gene expression, so they play an essential role not only as a diagnostic biomarker but also as a therapeutic and prognostic one. Also, miRNA biomarkers can be obtained from liquid biopsies, which are less intrusive than lung biopsies, and have better accessibility, safety and repeatability, which allows using those biomarkers both for diagnosis and monitoring of patients. In this review, we highlight the importance of miRNAs and collect the existing evidence of their relationship with lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer
"Clinicians handle a growing amount of clinical, biometric, and biomarker data. In this ""big data"" era, there is an emerging faith that the answer to all clinical and scientific questions reside in ""big data"" and that data will transform medicine into precision medicine. However, data by themselves are useless. It is the algorithms encoding causal reasoning and domain (e.g., clinical and biological) knowledge that prove transformative. The recent introduction of (health) data science presents an opportunity to re-think this data-centric view. For example, while precision medicine seeks to provide the right prevention and treatment strategy to the right patients at the right time, its realization cannot be achieved by algorithms that operate exclusively in data-driven prediction modes, as do most machine learning algorithms. Better understanding of data science and its tasks is vital to interpret findings and translate new discoveries into clinical practice. In this review, we first discuss the principles and major tasks of data science by organizing it into three defining tasks: (1) association and prediction, (2) intervention, and (3) counterfactual causal inference. Second, we review commonly-used data science tools with examples in the medical literature. Lastly, we outline current challenges and future directions in the fields of medicine, elaborating on how data science can enhance clinical effectiveness and inform medical practice. As machine learning algorithms become ubiquitous tools to handle quantitatively ""big data,"" their integration with causal reasoning and domain knowledge is instrumental to qualitatively transform medicine, which will, in turn, improve health outcomes of patients.",Generic
"Advancements in high-throughput sequencing have yielded vast amounts of genomic data, which are studied using genome-wide association study (GWAS)/phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) methods to identify associations between the genotype and phenotype. The associated findings have contributed to pharmacogenomics and improved clinical decision support at the point of care in many healthcare systems. However, the accumulation of genomic data from sequencing and clinical data from electronic health records (EHRs) poses significant challenges for data scientists. Following the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technology such as machine learning and deep learning, an increasing number of GWAS/PheWAS studies have successfully leveraged this technology to overcome the aforementioned challenges. In this review, we focus on the application of data science and AI technology in three areas, including risk prediction and identification of causal single-nucleotide polymorphisms, EHR-based phenotyping and CRISPR guide RNA design. Additionally, we highlight a few emerging AI technologies, such as transfer learning and multi-view learning, which will or have started to benefit genomic studies.",Generic

"Nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma, originating from thyroid epithelial cells, is the most frequent thyroid malignant neoplasia. Since 1955, there has been increasing evidence that this cancer may have a familial predisposition. It is now established that around 4.2% of all nonmedullary thyroid carcinomas occurs on the background of familial predisposition. These cases are often more aggressive, due to early onset, multifocality and a higher percentual of recurrences. An autossomal dominant inheritance pattern appears likely in most families, although the exact genes responsible for this syndrome have not yet been identified. Patients affected by this cancer should be treated with total thyroidectomy routinely and, in most cases, lymph node dissection, followed by iodine ablation and TSH suppressive therapy with levothyroxine. Some authors also recommend that first-degree relatives of patients with nonmedullary thyroid cancer (especially women) should be submitted to neck ultrasound for thyroid cancer screening, aiming early diagnosis for better treatment results.",Thyroid_Cancer
"It has been hypothesized that levels of triglycerides, glucose, and insulin are associated with risk of colon cancer and that diets high in simple sugars increase risk of colon cancer because of their impact on these factors. Limited epidemiological evidence supports the association between simple carbohydrates and risk of colon cancer. Using data from a population-based case-control study (n = 1993 cases and 2410 controls), we examined the associations between dietary sugars, foods containing high level of sugars, and dietary glycemic index (GI) and colon cancer. A dietary GI was developed to estimate metabolic response to a diet that may increase plasma glucose levels. Dietary data were obtained using a validated diet history questionnaire. High levels of sucrose intake were associated with increased risk of colon cancer among younger men [odds ratio (OR) for highest quintile relative to lowest, 1.59; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-2.37]. There was also a trend of increasing colon cancer risk associated with a higher sucrose:dietary ratio for proximal tumors in both men and women. Individuals with proximal tumors who consumed a diet ranked as having a high GI were at increased risk (for men, comparing highest quintile to lowest quintile: OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.06-2.36; P trend 0.04; for women: OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.11-2.67; P trend 0.04). Those at greatest risk from a high dietary GI were those who were sedentary (for men, relative to those who were most active and had a low-GI diet: OR, 3.46; 95% CI, 1.78-6.70; for women: OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.98-4.07). We also observed that people who had a high sucrose: dietary fiber ration and who also were sedentary and had a large body mass index were at increased risk (OR, 4.58; 95% CI, 2.33-8.98) relative to those who had a low sucrose:dietary fiber ratio, were active, and had low body mass indices. These findings support previous reports that dietary sugars, especially diet high in simple carbohydrates relative to complex carbohydrates, increase risk of colon cancer, possibly through their impact on plasma glucose levels.",Colon_Cancer
"Estimates of the frequency of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) based on clinical criteria have varied widely. Recent studies of germline mismatch repair gene mutations have suggested that HNPCC accounts for close to 3% of all colon cancer, but this estimate may have been inflated by inclusion of founder effects peculiar to Finland. We therefore determined by genetic criteria the colon cancer burden associated with HNPCC in a population-based study of 1066 individuals from Utah and California.",Colon_Cancer
"Animal tumor experiments and epidemiologic studies suggest that several agents may be of potential value in blocking the development of colon adenomas and carcinoma. Recent laboratory investigations have demonstrated several intermediate markers that are altered in the colonic epithelium of high-risk individuals and that can be modulated by several possible chemopreventive agents. Calcium and ascorbic acid are two agents that have been investigated in preliminary studies. Although the results have not been striking, these studies have pointed up methodologic issues that must be addressed and will contribute greatly to the design of the next generation of trials. Given the advances in the elucidation of the carcinogenic processes in colon cancer, it is reasonable to hope that the next decade of research will discover chemoprevention strategies that will protect individuals from the development of the most common tumor in Western society.",Colon_Cancer

"In SCLC, combination chemotherapy including agents such as etoposide, teniposide, cisplatin, carboplatin, doxorubicin, vincristine and cyclophosphamide continues to be the backbone of therapy. Epipodophyllotoxin derivatives, together with cisplatin or carboplatin are being increasingly used as part of the initial therapy. Complete plus partial responses to combination chemotherapy occur in 80-90% of all patients with a median duration of 9-11 months. Median survival in these studies is at present 11-16 months, depending on the initial tumour stage. At this point, 5-year survival is around 5% and includes a small fraction of patients (1%) initially presenting with extensive disease. The optimum duration of treatment is still uncertain, but the tendency is to shorten the duration of treatment to 6-9 months. The results of intensifying the treatment with the use of hematopoietic growth factors have hitherto been disappointing. The results of several phase II studies stress the importance of dose scheduling of etoposide in SCLC, with continuous treatment of 5 days' duration or more being superior. The therapeutic results for squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma and mesothelioma are essentially unchanged. The treatment of patients with these types of lung cancer should continue to be considered experimental, since no standard chemotherapy has as yet been developed, neither when given as single modality nor in combination with surgery or radiotherapy.",Lung_Cancer
"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is one of the most aggressive malignancies, with a poor prognosis.

In most the patients, complete surgical resection is not possible. There are, however, a few patients with resectable disease reported in the literature who have demonstrated long-term survival with aggressive multimodal therapy that included surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.

"Cellular senescence is a stress response involved in ageing and diverse disease processes including cancer, type-2 diabetes, osteoarthritis and viral infection.

We computationally screened various chemical libraries and validated the senolytic action of ginkgetin, periplocin and oleandrin in human cell lines under various modalities of senescence. The compounds have potency comparable to known senolytics, and we show that oleandrin has improved potency over its target as compared to best-in-class alternatives. Our approach led to several hundred-fold reduction in drug screening costs and demonstrates that artificial intelligence can take maximum advantage of small and heterogeneous drug screening data, paving the way for new open science approaches to early-stage drug discovery.",Generic
"Controversy exists about the relationship between hypergastrinemia and colon cancer. Conflicting lines of evidence may be interpreted to support a variety of views regarding the link between the two. Although some experimental and clinical data suggest a strong correlation, other studies refute this. It is likely that the actual situation lies between these two viewpoints; the complex nature of the relationship between carcinogenesis and putative gut hormones makes a definitive answer unlikely. Nevertheless, a critical reading of the recent literature suggests that hypergastrinemia does not play a direct role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Certain subgroups of patients with elevated serum gastrin levels and tumors that possess gastrin receptors may have accelerated tumor growth. Further study of this issue is warranted to elucidate the role of the gastrointestinal hormonal milieu in colorectal neoplasia.",Colon_Cancer
"External beam radiotherapy has a role in each histological type of thyroid cancer. For treatment confined to the thyroid bed, an antero--oblique wedged pair of beams is simple to apply. More frequently, however, the volume needs to include both sides of the neck and adequate dose must be given down to the level of the suprasternal notch, precluding use of lateral fields. Thus, anterior and posterior fields are usually necessary, extending from the tips of the mastoid processes or hyoid down to the carina and laterally to include both sides of the neck and supraclavicular fossae. The mandible and infraclavicular portions of both lungs are shielded, but there is no midline lead in the phase one volume. A mid-plane dose of 46 Gy given in 23 daily fractions results in an acceptable early radiation reaction and will avoid late damage to the spinal cord. Because of considerable variation of interplanar distance along the length of the volume, a lateral simulator film should be taken to determine the maximum cord dose. For most patients, a three-dimensional CT planned phase two volume will be required and should be determined prior to completing phase one. The optimum beam arrangement, usually incorporating conformal beam shaping assisted by use of a multileaf collimator, should avoid further dose to the cord. If there is additional dose to the spinal cord, this phase can be introduced before 46 Gy is reached.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Colon cancer is one of the most common, lethal diseases worldwide. Tumor metastasis and chemotherapy resistance are the main reasons for its poor prognosis and high fatality rate. Tumor development is thought of as one of the most complex cellular events as it is a multi-step cascading process involving infinite proliferation, invasion and immigration. Recently, increasing studies have demonstrated that microRNA-126 (miR-126) has an important role in colon cancer. The expression of miR-126 decreased significantly in colon cancer, particularly in highly metastatic cell lines. miR-126 controls tumor cell growth, metastasis and survival via inactivation of the oncogene signaling pathway, indicating that miR-126 may serve as a therapeutic target for anticancer therapy. Potentially, miR-126 was also reported to be an ideal molecular target as a novel biomarker for liver metastasis from colorectal cancer due to its changeable expression level. In the present review, the current knowledge regarding regulatory function of miR-126 is summarized along with its underlying mechanisms in colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer

"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Its high mortality is due to the poor prognosis of the disease caused by a late disease presentation, tumor heterogeneities within histological subtypes, and the relatively limited understanding of tumor biology. Importantly, lung cancer histological subgroups respond differently to some chemotherapeutic substances and side effects of some therapies appear to vary between subgroups. Biomarkers able to stratify for the subtype of lung cancer, prognosticate the course of disease, or predict the response to treatment are in high demand. In the last decade, microRNAs (miRNAs), measured in resected tumor samples or in fine needle aspirate samples have emerged as biomarkers for tumor diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of response to treatment, due to the ease of their detection and in their extreme specificity. Moreover, miRNAs present in sputum, in plasma, in serum or in whole blood have increasingly been explored in the last five years as less invasive biomarkers for the early detection of cancers. In this review we cover the increasing amounts of data that have accumulated in the last ten years on the use of miRNAs as lung cancer biomarkers.",Lung_Cancer

"To evaluate the importance of trace amounts of elements in thyroid cancer etiology and diagnostics, instrumental neutron activation analysis has been used to estimate Ag, Co, Cr, Fe, Hg, I,Rb, Sb, Sc, Se, and Zn concentrations in malignant and benign thyroid nodules as well as in apparently intact paranodular thyroid tissue. Resected material from 135 patients was obtained from operations. Forty-five cancer cases were diagnosed and the rest were of benign nodules. The thyroid glands of 65 people, 53 male and 12 female, who died and unexpected death or committed suicide, were used as a control group. Trace element contents of the International Atomic Energy Agency reference material H-4 (animal muscle) were analysed simultaneously with the thyroid tissue in order to evaluate the accuracy of the obtained data. No dependence of trace element contents on sex and age (14-80 years) was found for normal thyroids. In paranodular tissue, the Ag, Co, Hg, I and Rb contents were much higher for malignant and benign nodules than they were for the standard. There was also a slight deficiency of Se in the nodules compared with the standard. This result supports the hypothesis that the direct toxic heavy metal influence on thyrocytes plays a major role in thyroid cancer etiology, provided that an adequate level of the defence mechanisms is absent. Iodine concentrations are 15 times lower, on average, in malignant compared with benign nodules. It is also shown that the radio between the iodine concentration in nodular and paranodular tissue can be used for in vivo thyroid cancer diagnostics.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Sublobar resection for small lung cancers has been debated frequently and is still a controversial issue. The only randomised trial comparing lobectomy with sublobar resections found a significantly higher recurrence rate for the latter, but failed to show significant differences in survival, although survival was better for the lobectomy group. One meta-analysis and several nonrandomised comparisons have confirmed these results. In general, lobectomy and sublobar resections have similar 5-yr survival rates. Local recurrence after wedge resection is higher than after segmentectomy. However, for patients aged >71 yrs, lobectomy and wedge resection are associated with similar survival. For tumours of /=1 cm wide to avoid recurrence. For pure bronchioloalveolar carcinoma of </=2 cm, diagnosed intraoperatively with certainty, sublobar resection seems equivalent to lobectomy, and because there is no nodal involvement, systematic nodal dissection may not be necessary. In case of doubt, however, lobectomy with systematic nodal dissection will ensure complete resection and adequate staging. More randomised trials are needed to confirm all these issues.",Lung_Cancer

"The Chernobyl accident was followed by a large increase in the incidence of thyroid carcinoma in the areas exposed to high levels of fallout. The Chernobyl Tumor Bank was set up in 1998 to make tumours available for study internationally, and a pathology panel reviewed all the tumours and established an agreed diagnosis. The thyroid tumours that were discovered after the Chernobyl nuclear accident were virtually all (95%) of the papillary carcinoma type. Rare examples of other tumour types were identified. Within the papillary group, several subtypes were noted, including classical or usual type, follicular variant, solid variant and mixed patterns Diffuse sclerosis variant, cribriform/morular type and Warthin-like variant were rare. No tall cell or columnar cell variants were identified. The tumours examined by the Pathology Panel of the Chernobyl Tumor Bank constitute a large representative sample (estimated at about 50%) of the tumours that developed in this population.

Endobronchial brachytherapy, the placement of the source within the airway lumen, as a boost to conventional external beam radiation has not yet demonstrated improved local tumor control or overall survival as compared to external beam alone in the definitive treatment of inoperable lung cancer.

"From these data and data from the literature, our recommended treatment for well-differentiated cancer is as follows: For papillary cancer, resection should be adequate to encompass the entire tumor, which in most cases would be complete lobectomy and possibly isthmusectomy. Prophylactic neck dissection is of no value; therapeutic modified neck dissection should be done for stage II disease. Follicular cancer can be treated by lobectomy (for small lesions) or subtotal thyroidectomy. Although total or near-total thyroidectomy may be required in selected patients with large primary cancers or in those with extensive capsular invasion or extrathyroid extension, the number of cases indicating this is small. There were only a few such patients with large primaries requiring total thyroidectomy in this study. Total thyroidectomy is best avoided in most cases. considering the price of hypoparathyroidism and the lack of a significant improvement in survival compared with lesser ablative techniques. Postoperative ablation with iodine-131 did not improve survival in staged patients with papillary cancer (the number of patients with follicular cancer was too small for analysis). Postoperative thyroid suppression by exogenous thyroid hormone postoperatively appeared to improve survival. Although the data were not adequate for evaluation in follicular cancer, there seems to be no reason not to use this postoperatively in high risk patients with either papillary or follicular cancer.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Primordial germ cells (PGCs) generate new individuals through differentiation, maturation and fertilization. This means that the manipulation of PGCs is directly linked to the manipulation of individuals, making PGCs attractive target cells in the animal biotechnology field. A unique biological property of avian PGCs is that they circulate temporarily in the vasculature during early development, and this allows us to access and manipulate avian germ lines. Following the development of a technique for transplantation, PGCs have become central to avian biotechnology, in contrast to the use of embryo manipulation and subsequent transfer to foster mothers, as in mammalian biotechnology. Today, avian PGC transplantation combined with recent advanced manipulation techniques, including cell purification, cryopreservation, depletion, and long-term culture in vitro, have enabled the establishment of genetically modified poultry lines and ex-situ conservation of poultry genetic resources. This chapter introduces the principles, history, and procedures of producing avian germline chimeras by transplantation of PGCs, and the current status of avian germline modification as well as germplasm cryopreservation. Other fundamental avian reproductive technologies are described, including artificial insemination and embryo culture, and perspectives of industrial applications in agriculture and pharmacy are considered, including poultry productivity improvement, egg modification, disease resistance impairment and poultry gene ""pharming"" as well as gene banking.",Generic
"The rise and fall of artificial neural networks is well documented in the scientific literature of both computer science and computational chemistry. Yet almost two decades later, we are now seeing a resurgence of interest in deep learning, a machine learning algorithm based on multilayer neural networks. Within the last few years, we have seen the transformative impact of deep learning in many domains, particularly in speech recognition and computer vision, to the extent that the majority of expert practitioners in those field are now regularly eschewing prior established models in favor of deep learning models. In this review, we provide an introductory overview into the theory of deep neural networks and their unique properties that distinguish them from traditional machine learning algorithms used in cheminformatics. By providing an overview of the variety of emerging applications of deep neural networks, we highlight its ubiquity and broad applicability to a wide range of challenges in the field, including quantitative structure activity relationship, virtual screening, protein structure prediction, quantum chemistry, materials design, and property prediction. In reviewing the performance of deep neural networks, we observed a consistent outperformance against non-neural networks state-of-the-art models across disparate research topics, and deep neural network-based models often exceeded the ""glass ceiling"" expectations of their respective tasks. Coupled with the maturity of GPU-accelerated computing for training deep neural networks and the exponential growth of chemical data on which to train these networks on, we anticipate that deep learning algorithms will be a valuable tool for computational chemistry. 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Generic
"Thyroid neoplasms encompass a variety of lesions that range from benign adenomas to malignancies. These latter can be well-differentiated, poorly differentiated or undifferentiated (anaplastic) carcinomas. More than 95% of thyroid cancers are derived from thyroid follicular cells, while 2-3% (medullary thyroid cancers, MTC) originate from calcitonin producing C-cells. Over the last decade, investigators have developed a clearer understanding of genetic alterations underlying thyroid carcinogenesis. A number of point mutations and translocations are involved, not only in its tumorigenesis, but also as have potential use as diagnostic and prognostic indicators and therapeutic targets. Many occur in genes for several important signaling pathways, in particular the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Sporadic (isolated) lesions account for 75% of MTC cases, while inherited MTC, often in association with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A and 2B syndromes, constitute the remainder. However, non-MEN familial MTC may also occur. Advances in genetic testing have revolutionized the management of MTC, with prospects of genetic screening, testing and early prophylactic thyroidectomy. Ethical concerns of these advances are addressed.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Introduction: Although lymph node metastases are common with papillary thyroid cancer, parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal lymph node metastases are relatively rare. Although small metastatic parapharyngeal lymph nodes (e.g., Materials and Methods: A 47-year-old female presented with a 2 cm conventional papillary thyroid cancer in the right thyroid lobe with central right lateral neck metastases, as well as a 2.5 cm right parapharyngeal lymph node metastasis extending to the skull base. Surgical technique for transcervical resection of the 2.5 cm parapharyngeal lymph node is illustrated, identifying important anatomical structures. Results: After opening the right neck and removing the right level 2 lymph nodes (not illustrated), the parapharyngeal space is exposed. First, the posterior belly of the digastric and stylohyoid muscles is divided. Next, the hypoglossal nerve is identified and mobilized. Branches of the external carotid artery are then divided and retracted. The sympathetic chain is visualized posterior to the internal carotid artery. The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is visualized as it courses posterior to the carotid artery. After gentle retraction of the hypoglossal nerve, superior laryngeal nerve, carotid artery, and sympathetic chain, the parapharyngeal space is exposed with the aforementioned metastatic lymph node. The metastatic lymph node is then freed from the alar fascial and skull base attachments and removed en bloc. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first video demonstration of a transcervical parapharyngeal lymph node resection in the peer-reviewed literature. Transcervical excision of parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal lymph nodes requires a thorough understanding of the anatomy of the neck and parapharyngeal space, along with a stepwise surgical technique to safely expose the parapharyngeal space.

"Cancer is a major public health problem in the modern world. Every year, new cases of cancer are diagnosed around the world. Cancer cells are altered cells that have escaped the mechanisms that regulate natural growth. Bacteriocins are cationic peptides synthesized by ribosomes that are secreted by almost all groups of bacteria. Some bacteriocins have shown selective toxicity to cancer cells compared to normal cells. This makes them other candidates for research and clinical trials.",Colon_Cancer
"Primary thyroid malignancies typically do not interfere with thyroid function. A patient is reported with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma presenting with hyperthyroidism; this is believed to be the first such case described. Prior to the onset of the thyroidal process, the patient was clinically euthyroid.

"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Most patients present symptomatically when the disease is often at an advanced stage and prognosis is poor. In contrast, outcomes are significantly better in patients diagnosed at earlier stages, with a 5-year survival for stage I approaching 75%. Screening for lung cancer may detect potentially fatal cases earlier in their disease course, at a stage when a curative surgical intervention is feasible. The objective of this review is to examine the current evidence for lung cancer screening and the clinical effectiveness of screening for lung cancer by using computed tomography.",Lung_Cancer
"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in the United States and globally with the majority of lung cancer cases attributable to cigarette smoking. Given the high societal and personal cost of a diagnosis of lung cancer including that most cases of lung cancer when diagnosed are found at a late stage, work over the past 40 years has aimed to detect lung cancer earlier when curative treatment is possible. Screening trials using chest radiography and sputum failed to show a reduction in lung cancer mortality however multiple studies using low dose CT have shown the ability to detect lung cancer early and a survival benefit to those screened. This review will discuss the history of lung cancer screening, current recommendations and screening guidelines, and implementation and components of a lung cancer screening program.",Lung_Cancer
Thyroid cancers are especially common in patients who have received irradiation to the head and neck region for benign diseases. Well-differentiated papillary and/or follicular carcinomas are the most common types of thyroid cancer. They grow slowly and have a very good prognosis when managed with an appropriate combination of surgical and medical therapy. Other types of thyroid cancer often require more intensive therapy and follow-up. It is especially important to evaluate relatives of patients with medullary thyroid cancer.,Thyroid_Cancer

"In this paper investigations concerning the interactions at the interface between tumor cells and tumor stroma are reviewed. As a model for tumor cell-extracellular matrix interaction human colorectal carcinoma cell lines, in vitro and in vivo, in nude mouse xenografts, were chosen. Based on the available data and on a review of the literature the following conclusions can be drawn. Most malignant epithelial neoplasms at the site of tumor cell invasion display defects in the epithelial basement membrane. This is not merely the result of enzymatic dissolution but rather reflects a shift in basement membrane turnover towards degradation. Elsewhere in the same primary tumor or in a metastasis the balance might be shifted more towards basement membrane deposition. The tendency of a tumor to deposit basement membranes reflects the biological potential of the neoplasm. Basement membranes are deposited by stromal cells or by a concerted action of tumor and stromal cells. Differentiation in a carcinoma is modulated by factors in the extracellular matrix. Endocrine differentiation can be induced in vitro by native basement membranes but also by direct contact of the tumor cells with fibroblasts. Basic FGF is one of the extracellular matrix factors with differentiation inducing capacity. Expression of cell adhesion molecules and integrin receptors tends to be down-regulated in carcinoma cells. Alterations in the expression of these proteins might not be constitutive but rather modulated by the direct environment of the tumor cell and might not only include quantitative alterations but also changes in their cell surface distribution, causing or following loss of cell polarity.",Colon_Cancer
"Neovascularization in carcinogenesis and tumor progression is well-established. Molecular mediators implicated in different modes of vascular remodeling and expansion (e.g. sprouting angiogenesis (SA), vasculogenesis, vascular mimicry) are evaluated as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in different malignant tumors. Significant progress has been made in the understanding of the complex interplay between thyroid cancer (TC) cells and the tumor microenvironment, thus unraveling the role of angiogenic mediators. Areas covered: This review summarizes current research on neovascularization and TC. Current knowledge on vascular remodeling, in the context of carcinogenesis, is presented. Preclinical and clinical data from TC studies are also discussed. Expert opinion: There is a remarkable effort to pharmacologically target several key molecules of vessel-forming cascades. Despite encouraging preclinical results, clinical outcomes in TC are not optimal, possibly reflecting knowledge gaps in the pathophysiology of neovascularization in thyroid tissue. Increasing amounts of data support the possibility that redundancy of pathways that regulate vascular network remodeling allows tumors to adapt in different conditions. Hypothesizing that alternative forms of neovascularization upregulate when SA is pharmacologically blocked, targeting two or more different pathways of neovascularization could be a promising future strategy. Further research is required to explore molecular mechanisms of neovascularization in TC.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Lung cancer is the commonest cause of death from cancer in both men and women, with approximately 152,000 new cases and 139,000 deaths in 1988. The incidence and mortality rates are increasing rapidly in women. Two main tests have been used to screen for lung cancer: chest roentgenography and sputum cytology. Four recent controlled trials and one case-control study failed, however, to show that screening reduces lung cancer mortality even in high-risk persons (smokers). In the Mayo Lung Project, for example, the lung cancer death rate in high-risk men offered sputum cytology and chest roentgenogram every 4 months was 3.1 per 1000 person-years, compared with 3.0 per 1000 person-years in a control group. Chest roentgenograms and sputum cytology lead to false-positive test results in smokers of approximately 5% and 0.5%, respectively. Because of the lack of evidence of benefit and because of its potential harms and costs, screening for lung cancer is not recommended.",Lung_Cancer

"Alterations in sphingolipid metabolism, especially ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate, have been linked to colon cancer, suggesting that enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism may emerge as novel regulators and targets in colon cancer. Neutral ceramidase (nCDase), a key enzyme in sphingolipid metabolism that hydrolyzes ceramide into sphingosine, is highly expressed in the intestine; however, its role in colon cancer has not been defined. Here we show that molecular and pharmacological inhibition of nCDase in colon cancer cells increases ceramide, and this is accompanied by decreased cell survival and increased apoptosis and autophagy, with minimal effects on noncancerous cells. Inhibition of nCDase resulted in loss of -catenin and inhibition of ERK, components of pathways relevant for colon cancer development. Furthermore, inhibition of nCDase in a xenograft model delayed tumor growth and increased ceramide while decreasing proliferation. It is noteworthy that mice lacking nCDase treated with azoxymethane were protected from tumor formation. Taken together, these studies show that nCDase is pivotal for regulating initiation and development of colon cancer, and these data suggest that this enzyme is a suitable and novel target for colon cancer therapy.-Garc a-Barros, M., Coant, N., Kawamori, T., Wada, M., Snider, A.

"Lung cancer is nowadays the most spread cancer worldwide, being the main cause of death of all cancers. Lung cancer is the most important and frequent type of lung tumour, representing over 90% of all cases of primary malignant and benign lung tumours. The most deaths of lung cancer occur at 35-75 age group. In the eighties, lung cancer was estimated to be almost 16% of all cancers worldwide and almost 23% of all cancers in Europe. In 1999, lung cancer relative frequency in USA was on top, being followed by colonic cancer and breast cancer relative frequency. In the same year, relative frequency of lung cancer was higher in USA than in Romania both for men (33.97% to 28.4%) and for women (about three times higher in USA than in Romania). According to statistics, lung cancer mortality rate in Romania in 1999 was on the first place in men (comparative with mortality rate of other cancers) and on the third place in women (after breast cancer and uterine collum cancer mortality rate). Lung cancer mortality rate in Romania increased significantly in 1985-2003 period, from 24.9%000 in 1985, to 39.7%000 in 2003. In 2000 year, lung cancer incidence for men in Romania (67.1%000) was lower than in Yugoslavia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Bulgaria but higher than its corresponding value in Macedonia and Albania. Prospective statistic studies estimate that in 2020 year lung cancer incidence for men will be the highest in Greece, Spain and France and the lowest in Great Britain, Ireland, Finland and Sweden. For women, the highest lung cancer incidence is estimated to be in Holland, Denmark and Austria and the lowest in Spain, Ireland and Finland.",Lung_Cancer

"The pathogenesis of sporadic colorectal cancer involves distinct pathways, with characteristic genomic alterations. The first pathway, chromosome instability (CIN), is driven by APC mutations and is typified by Kras mutations, p53 mutation/loss of heterozygosity, and deletions at chromosome 18q. The second pathway is referred to as microsatellite instability (MSI), a genetic hallmark of the accumulated mutations that occur as a consequence of derangements in the mismatch repair genes. Finally, proximal colon cancers may involve methylation of a number of genes, which is frequently referred to as the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), and are associated with B-raf mutations. The ability to stratify colorectal cancers by risk would be facilitated by the identification of polymorphisms that might be utilized as biomarkers.

"Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy. Most thyroid cancer types respond well to conventional treatment consisting of surgery and radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy. Unfortunately, some thyroid cancer types are resistant to surgical and RAI therapy. Multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) can be used in the treatment of advanced refractory thyroid cancers. The objective of this review is to give an update on MKI treatment (lenvatinib, sorafenib, sunitinib, cabozantinib, pazopanib, vandetanib) of thyroid cancer, regarding its efficacy and safety profile. We evaluated 212 articles through a PubMed search. A total of 20 articles met the inclusion and none the exclusion criteria. The studies showed promising progression-free survival rates compared to placebo treatment from earlier studies and similar or better results compared to the SELECT and DECISION trials. Adverse effects (AEs) are substantial in the treatment with MKIs. Almost all patients treated with these novel drugs experienced AEs. It is therefore crucial to focus on the management of AEs for a decent long-term outcome. The AEs are often more severe in patients with high efficacy of MKIs, which could indicate a correlation.

"Objective. To present a complicated case of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) with metastases to the skull that was evident on I-131 whole body scan (WBS) but negative on other imaging modalities in a low risk patient. Methods. We will discuss clinical course, imaging, pathological findings, and treatment of the patient with skull metastasis from DTC. Pertinent literature on imaging and pathology findings as well as radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment impact on quality of life and survival in patients with bone metastases from DTC will be reviewed. Results. The patient is a 37-year-old woman with a diagnosis of DTC who had focal areas of increased uptake in the head on WBS with no correlative findings on CT and MRI. Initially, false positive findings were suspected since patient had a low risk for developing metastases. However, the persistent findings on post-RAI treatment WBS, following two courses of treatment, were highly concerning for metastatic bone disease. WBC performed 6 months following the second RAI treatment revealed resolution of the findings. Conclusions. False positive findings in WBS are frequent and may be due to contamination, perspiration, or folliculitis of the scalp as well as benign lesions such as meningioma, hematoma, cavernous angioma, and metallic sutures. However, metastatic disease should always be considered even if the patient has low risk of distant metastatic disease and correlative images do not support the diagnosis.

For the small sized lung cancers, several clinical studies for limited surgery and stereotactic radiation therapy are on going now. On the other hand, based on the development of radiation and chemotherapy, treatment results of locally advanced lung cancer are improving. Several studies reported that postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy improved the prognosis by 10-15%. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy have also been reported to improve the postoperative survival compared with the treatment by surgery alone.

"Lung cancer is a major public health problem and the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Its survival rates have changed little over the past 20 years. The best clinical benefit (ie, survival rates) with combination cytotoxic therapies in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may have been reached. The need for improved survival rates in NSCLC has driven the development of novel, rationally designed, targeted therapies. Inhibitors of angiogenesis have been developed and are increasingly studied. Potential targets for therapy include inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors, and cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Combining targeted molecules with traditional cytotoxic therapies usually results in lower required chemotherapy doses and fewer, less severe side effects.

According to the cancer stem cell model, malignancies originate from a small fraction of cancer cells that show self-renewal and pluripotency and are capable of initiating and sustaining tumor growth (Boman and Wicha in J Clin Oncol 26:2795-2799, 2008). The cancer-initiating cells or ""cancer stem cells"" were first identified in hematologic malignancies and most recently in several solid tumors, including CRC. The hypothesis of stem cell-driven tumorigenesis in colon cancer raises questions as to whether current treatments are able to efficiently target the tumorigenic cell population that is responsible for tumor growth and maintenance. This review will focus on the different aspects of stem cell biology in the context of CRC, which might help to understand the mechanisms that give rise to tumor development and resistance to therapy. First, we will briefly revise the knowledge available on normal intestinal stem cells and recent advances in understanding crypt biology, which have led to new theory on the origins of colon adenomas and cancers. Then, we will summarize the evidence and current status on colon cancer stem cells, focusing on their relevance and promises for the treatment of colorectal carcinoma.",Colon_Cancer
"The development of colorectal cancer has been predicted to inolve the enteric microbiome. In this issue of Cell Host & Microbe, Kordahi et al. (2021) address this predisposition by identifying not just pathobiont micro-organisms but also distinct microbial signatures within those bacteria that predict the presence of pre-cancerous polyps.",Colon_Cancer
"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression by binding the 3' noncoding region of the messenger RNA targets inducing their cleavage or blocking the protein translation. They play important roles in multiple biological and metabolic processes, including developmental timing, signal transduction, and cell maintenance and differentiation. Their deregulation can predispose to diseases and cancer. miRNA expression has been demonstrated to be deregulated in many types of human tumors, including thyroid cancers, and could be responsible for tumor initiation and progression. In this paper we reviewed the available data on miRNA deregulation in different thyroid tumors and describe the putative role of miRNA in thyroid cancer development.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Although thyroid cancer usually has an excellent prognosis, few therapeutic options are available in the refractory setting. Based on the recent results of phase II studies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, we designed a retrospective analysis of patients with metastatic thyroid cancer treated with sorafenib in seven Spanish referral centers. Consecutive patients with progressive metastatic thyroid cancer (papillary, follicular, medullary, and anaplastic) not suitable for curative surgery, radioactive-iodine therapy, or radiotherapy were treated with sorafenib 400 mg twice a day. The primary end point was objective response rate (RR). Secondary end points included toxicity, median progression-free survival (mPFS), median overall survival (mOS), and correlation between tumor marker levels (thyroglobulin, calcitonin, and carcinoembryonic antigen) and efficacy. Between June 2006 and January 2010, 34 patients were included in the study. Sixteen patients presented differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTC) of which seven (21%) were papillary, nine (26%) follicular, 15 (44%) medullary (MTC), and three (9%) were anaplastic (ATC). Eleven (32%) patients achieved partial response and 14 (41%) had stable disease beyond 6 months. Regarding histological subtype, RRs were 47% (seven of 15) for MTC, 19% (three of 16) for DTC, and 33% (one of three) for ATC. With a median follow-up of 11.5 months, mPFS were 13.5, 10.5, and 4.4 months for DTC, MTC, and ATC respectively. Tumor markers were evaluated in 22 patients, and a statistically significant association was observed between RR and decrease in tumor marker levels >50% (P=0.033). In this retrospective trial, sorafenib showed antitumor efficacy in all histological subtypes of thyroid cancer, warranting further development in this setting.",Thyroid_Cancer
"European governments are struggling to regain economic strength in the coronavirus pandemic as in many countries the number of new infections seems to gradually subside. Growth rates deep in the red call for a reconstruction programme when the crisis is finally manageable and economic activity can resume. Amidst this, there are again influential groups that claim ""this is not the time to insist on strict climate protection goals"". On the contrary, the ongoing COVID-19 crisis has clearly illustrated what climate disasters, often occurring locally, could do to the life of citizens. The reconstruction programme needs to initiate the great green transition. The transformation from a climate-distorting to a climate-protecting economy opens up investment opportunities and points to financing needs comparable with those necessary for the rebuilding of the European economy after World War II. The great green transition is a unique chance to pursue policies for a new and sustainable growth regime.",Generic
"Bronchoplastic procedures for patients with lung cancer are designed to achieve radical cure with preservation of functioning lung parenchyma. The operative results of 139 cases of lung cancer who underwent bronchoplasty between 1963 through 2007 were reviewed. The mean age of the patients was 62.5 years (range, 20 to 78 years). Sleeve lobectomy (SL) was performed in 119 cases, wedge lobectomy (WL) in 10 cases, sleeve segmentectomy (SS) in 5 cases, wedge segmentectomy (WS) in 2 cases, sleeve resection (SR) in 2 cases, and wedge resection (WR) in 1 case. Squamous cell carcinoma was the most frequently encountered histological type of disease (78%), followed by adenocarcinoma (12%) and other histological types (10%). The tumor was central in 125 patients (90%) and peripheral with nodal involvement in 14 patients (10%). Vascular resection and reconstruction was performed in 16 patients. Early major bronchial anastomotic complications occurred in 6 patients (4.3%). The 5-year survival rate in the patients with squamous cell carcinoma was 63.2%, and in patients with adenocarcinoma was 26.3%. SS for patients with early-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the segmental bronchus is a curative operation with preservation of the pulmonary function. Bronchoplasty without lung resection (SR, WR) is a reliable method for patients with low-grade malignant polypoid tumors arising from the bronchus. Patients with adenocarcinoma, N2 disease or major bronchial anastomotic complication show a worse prognosis.",Lung_Cancer
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. Aggressive research in the last decade has led to a wealth of information about this disease; for example, we now know that more than 80% of sporadic colon tumors contain mutations in the Wnt and TGF signaling pathways. The latest avenue of research is revealing the existence of and role for the cancer stem cell (CSC) model, which promotes the idea that malignancies originate from a small fraction of cancer cells that show self-renewal and multi- or pluripotency. The model also endorses that CSCs are capable of initiating and sustaining tumor growth. The body of evidence in favor of the CSC model is rapidly growing and includes analyses from flow cytometry of numerous CSC biomarkers, abnormal signaling pathways, symmetric division, dietary augmentation, and analysis of the behavior of these cells in spheroid culture formation. Although the incidence of death from CRC remains high, fervent research, both basic and translational, is beginning to improve patient outcomes. This paper focuses on stem cell biology in the context of CRC to help understand the mechanisms leading to tumor development and therapy resistance, with possible therapeutic indications.",Colon_Cancer
"The incidence of lung cancer is increasing in Denmark, especially among women. Today, smoking is the most important risk factor for developing this disease. A review of the literature shows that the prognosis is still very poor regardless of histologic findings. Chemotherapy prolongs life moderately among patients with small cell carcinoma (SCLC). Furthermore, total resection of non small cell cancer (NSCLC) may improve survival over several years. In patients investigated for surgery, cancer dissemination should be determined, using radiologic and invasive investigations. A detailed spirometric investigation should also be performed, as lung function is a predictor of postoperative survival. Other kinds of treatment are available, and good coordination regarding information, supportive arrangements and symptomatic treatment is important.",Lung_Cancer
"ERCC1 plays a critical role in the repair of lesions in DNA induced by cisplatin. It has been demonstrated that, in patients with resected NSCLC, those with ERCC1-negative tumours had greater benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy than patients with ERCC1-positive tumours. On the other hand, patients with ERCC1-positive tumours have a better prognosis. ERCC1 can be evaluated either by the level of protein expression on immunohistochemical analysis or by quantification of its mRNA expression. At present ERCC1 appears to be a promising biomarker for predicting the benefit of cisplatin based chemotherapy and its modulation could allow sensitisation of tumour cells to this drug. Its use in daily clinical practice requires a further stage of prospective validation studies which are already in progress in patients both with completely resected NSCL or metastatic disease.",Lung_Cancer
"Using a Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) framework, this study examined whether factual colon cancer information is a meaningful source of exercise motivation for relatives of patients with colon cancer. One hundred sixty-six inactive relatives were randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: PMT group (intervention); and non-PMT group (attention control). At baseline (T1) participants completed demographic information, a questionnaire designed to assess their beliefs toward exercise and colon cancer as well as their exercise intentions. At T2 (one week following T1) participants watched one of two DVD videos that were created for the study. The intervention DVD contained exercise and colon cancer information that was yoked within the four major components of PMT: perceived vulnerability (PV); perceived severity (PS); response efficacy (RE); and self-efficacy (SE), while the attention control DVD contained general diet and cancer information. Immediately following watching the DVD, participants completed the same measures as in T1. Participants assigned to the PMT intervention group showed significant improvement in PV, RE, SE and exercise intentions, whereas participants assigned to the attention control group showed significant improvement only in RE. RE, SE, and PS made significant and unique contributions to prediction of exercise intention. Overall, the results of the present study demonstrate that a single exposure media intervention grounded in a PMT framework can change individuals' exercise and colon cancer beliefs, as well as change their exercise intentions. Implications of these findings and direction for future research are discussed.",Colon_Cancer
"Most colorectal cancers (CRCs) are moderately differentiated or well differentiated, a status that is preserved even in metastatic tumors. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC differentiation remain to be elucidated. Herein, we unravel a potentially novel posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism via a LIN28B/CDX2 signaling axis that plays a critical role in mediating CRC differentiation. Owing to a large number of mRNA targets, the mRNA-binding protein LIN28B has diverse functions in development, metabolism, tissue regeneration, and tumorigenesis. Our RNA-binding protein IP (RIP) assay revealed that LIN28B directly binds CDX2 mRNA, which is a pivotal homeobox transcription factor in normal intestinal epithelial cell identity and differentiation. Furthermore, LIN28B overexpression resulted in enhanced CDX2 expression to promote differentiation in subcutaneous xenograft tumors generated from CRC cells and metastatic tumor colonization through mesenchymal-epithelial transition in CRC liver metastasis mouse models. A ChIP sequence for CDX2 identified -methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) as a potentially novel transcriptional target of CDX2 in the context of LIN28B overexpression. We also found that AMACR enhanced intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity, which is known as a key component of intestinal differentiation, through the upregulation of butyric acid. Overall, we demonstrated that LIN28B promotes CRC differentiation through the CDX2/AMACR axis.",Colon_Cancer

"Background: Colon cancer (CC) is the fifth most prevalent cancer around the globe and poses a major risk to human health. Even though Kremen2 serves as a prognostic indicator in individuals with malignant tumours, its role in evaluating the prognosis of individuals with colon cancer has not been confirmed. Methods: Here, we examined the protein expression of Kremen2 in CC tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC), then analyzed the clinical and RNA-seq data presented in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to confirm the relationship between Kremen2 levels and CC. In addition, the associations between Kremen2 mRNA expression and infiltrating immune cells were examined. Results: The study showed that the mRNA expression and protein level of Kremen2 were increased in CC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, high Kremen2 expression in CC was linked to poor overall survival and progression-free survival. Clinical correlation analysis highlighted that a high level of Kremen2 expression was strongly linked with tumour progression, particularly lymph node metastasis. Cox regression analysis highlighted that Kremen2 was an independent prognostic indicator for CC. Bioinformatic studies highlighted that Kremen2 might be associated with the immune status in CC. Conclusion: Increased Kremen2 could serve as a potential prognostic CC biomarker.",Colon_Cancer
"This is an updated version of the original review published in The Cochrane Library in 1999 and updated in 2004 and 2010.

"The goal of the palliative resection can be threefold: relief of symptoms without expected survival benefit, obviation of an urgent situation and maintenance or restoration of a good quality survival. Clear distinction should be made between this type of operation and incomplete resection: in spite of a curative intent, the latter type of operation is characterized either by residual disease or positive most distal lymph node station. Classification of palliative operations for lung cancer based on the underlying pathology seems to be most suitable for clinical use: 1) tumours without extrapulmonary extension; 2) tumours with direct involvement of adjacent organs; 3) metastatic involvement of intrathoracic or distant organs; 4) lung tumours associated with nonmalignant pathology (lung suppuration, pleural empyema). Although palliative operations for lung cancer can be considered in carefully selected patients, they should always be avoided if other, less aggressive non-surgical procedures offer the same quality of palliation.",Lung_Cancer
"Analyses of global financial markets are dominated by atomized models of decision-making and behavioural psychology ('exuberance' or 'panic'). In contrast, this paper argues that overwhelmingly, finance organizations rather than 'individuals' make decisions, and routinely use emotions in formulating expectations. Keynes introduced emotion (business confidence and animal spirits) but in economics, emotion remains individualistic and irrational. Luhmann's system theory lies at the other extreme, where emotions like trust and confidence are central variables, functional in the reduction of complexity in sub-systems like the economy. The gap between irrational emotions aggregated to 'herd' behaviour in economics, and 'system trust' applied to finance and money as a 'medium of communication' in sociology, remains largely unfilled. This paper argues that while organizations cannot be said to 'think' or 'feel', they are rational and emotional, because impersonal trust, confidence and their contrary emotions are unavoidable in decision-making due to fundamental uncertainty. These future-oriented emotions are prevalent within and between organizations in the financial sector, primarily in generating expectations. The dynamic of corporate activities of tense and ruthless struggle is a more plausible level of analysis than either financial 'manias' in aggregate or 'system trust'.",Generic
"In the last decade remarkable progress has been made in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer due to the introduction of oxaliplatin and irinotecan in clinical practice. The addition of biological agents seems to offer a chance to further enhance the activity of conventional chemotherapy. Cetuximab, a chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibody targeting the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has shown low but detectable activity when employed in pretreated patients either as a single agent or in combination with irinotecan. Cetuximab in combination with irinotecan has been registered in the USA and Europe for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer expressing the EGFR after failure of prior irinotecan-based cytotoxic therapy. The role of cetuximab in first-line therapy is still investigational. Some phase II trials assessing cetuximab plus chemotherapy demonstrated a high objective response rate and promising results in terms of time to progression and overall survival; data from phase III trials are pending. Further studies are needed to investigate the efficacy of cetuximab in combination with conventional chemotherapy in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting and to define criteria for a better selection of patients for this type of treatment.",Colon_Cancer
"Alternative splicing of ten different variant exons (v1-v10) is responsible for the creation of a large number of different CD44 surface proteins. Some of these proteins play decisive roles in the metastatic spread of rat tumours. Also in human cancers, CD44 splice variants are frequently expressed in advanced states of tumorigenesis. In breast cancer and in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas expression of exon v6 is correlated with poor prognosis of patient survival. In colorectal carcinogenesis, expression of exon v5 is an early tumour marker since it is already detectable on small dysplastic polyps (but not on normal colon epithelium). In contrast, exon v6 expression occurred with increased frequency with tumour progression, and its expression on colorectal tumours indicated reduced survival probability. Most likely, tumours carrying the CD44 v6 epitope acquire selective advantage during tumour progression and metastasis formation. This could be a proliferative advantage since mice transgenic for the CD44 isoform CD44v4-v7 on T lymphocytes show an accelerated T-dependent immune response as compared with non-transgenic siblings.",Colon_Cancer
"In modern clinical practice, digital pathology has a crucial role and is increasingly a technological requirement in the scientific laboratory environment. The advent of whole-slide imaging, availability of faster networks, and cheaper storage solutions has made it easier for pathologists to manage digital slide images and share them for clinical use. In parallel, unprecedented advances in machine learning have enabled the synergy of artificial intelligence and digital pathology, which offers image-based diagnosis possibilities that were once limited only to radiology and cardiology. Integration of digital slides into the pathology workflow, advanced algorithms, and computer-aided diagnostic techniques extend the frontiers of the pathologist's view beyond a microscopic slide and enable true utilisation and integration of knowledge that is beyond human limits and boundaries, and we believe there is clear potential for artificial intelligence breakthroughs in the pathology setting.

"Thyroid cancer, although a rare disease, may cause significant disability and even death. Its proper surgical management is based on an understanding of the different biolgoic behavior of the four subtypes. Papillary and follicular cancers are best managed by total lobectomy on the side of the lesion and subtotal lobectomy on the contralateral side, unless there is gross disease bilaterally or distant metastasis (in which circumstances total thyroidectomy is performed). Cervical lymph node metastasis, when present, is handled satisfactorily by modified neck dissection. Because of its high incidence of multicentricity and its more serious prognosis, medullary thyroid carcinoma is managed by total thyroidectomy and--usually--radical neck dissection for involved nodes. For anaplastic carcinoma, there is no effective treatment at present. Postoperatively, all patients should be given suppressive doses of thyroid hormone to prevent myxedema and to prevent cancer from recurring. Radioiodine therapy may be of value in suppressing metastasis of some papillary and follicular cancers that exhibit a high degree of follicular differentiation.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are aiding in improving sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic imaging. The rapid adoption of these advanced ML algorithms is transforming imaging analysis; taking us from noninvasive detection of pathology to noninvasive precise diagnosis of the pathology by identifying whether detected abnormality is a secondary to infection, inflammation and/or neoplasm. This is led to the emergence of ""Radiobiogenomics""; referring to the concept of identifying biologic (genomic, proteomic) alterations in the detected lesion. Radiobiogenomic involves image segmentation, feature extraction, and ML model to predict underlying tumor genotype and clinical outcomes. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer related death worldwide. There are several histologic subtypes of lung cancer, e.g., small cell lung cancer (SCLC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma). These variable histologic subtypes not only appear different at microscopic level, but these also differ at genetic and transcription level. This intrinsic heterogeneity reveals itself as different morphologic appearances on diagnostic imaging, such as CT, PET/CT and MRI. Traditional evaluation of imaging findings of lung cancer is limited to morphologic characteristics, such as lesion size, margins, density. Radiomics takes image analysis a step further by looking at imaging phenotype with higher order statistics in efforts to quantify intralesional heterogeneity. This heterogeneity, in turn, can be potentially used to extract intralesional genomic and proteomic data. This review aims to highlight novel concepts in ML and AI and their potential applications in identifying radiobiogenomics of lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer
"DNA methylation exerts critical effects on gene-expression regulation in normal cells, and alterations on the normal methylation patterns characterize, and likely contribute, to cancer development and progression.

"The use of laparoscopy has become widespread across many surgical specialties. Its utility as treatment for colon cancer was initially met with hesitancy due to concern for port site and wound recurrences; however, this was later disproven by large retrospective series. Subsequently, there have been multiple, large, prospective, randomized studies evaluating laparoscopic versus open colectomy for colon cancer. All studies yielded similar results and showed no statistical difference in overall survival, disease-free survival, and recurrence. Additionally, these studies revealed similar operative outcomes with respect to complication rates, perioperative mortality, and conversion to open colectomy, as well as equivalent oncologic resections. Overall in the laparoscopic colectomy groups, hospital stays were shorter, and often times patients required less narcotics postoperatively, but laparoscopic operative times were longer. With adequate training, the use of laparoscopy can be safely employed for patients with colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States and worldwide. Since lung cancer outcomes are dependent on stage at diagnosis with early disease resulting in longer survival, the goal of screening is to capture lung cancer in its early stages when it can be treated and cured. Multiple studies have evaluated the use of chest X-ray (CXR) with or without sputum cytologic examination for lung cancer screening, but none has demonstrated a mortality benefit. In contrast, the multicenter National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) from the United States found a 20 % reduction in lung cancer mortality following three consecutive screenings with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in high-risk current and former smokers. Data from European trials are not yet available. In addition to a mortality benefit, lung cancer screening with LDCT also offers a unique opportunity to promote smoking cessation and abstinence and may lead to the diagnoses of treatable chronic diseases, thus decreasing the overall disease burden. The risks of lung cancer screening include overdiagnosis, radiation exposure, and false-positive results leading to unnecessary testing and possible patient anxiety and distress. However, the reduction in lung cancer mortality is a benefit that outweighs the risks and major health organizations currently recommend lung cancer screening using age, smoking history, and quit time criteria derived from the NLST. Although more research is needed to clearly define and understand the application and utility of lung cancer screening in the general population, current data support that lung cancer screening is effective and should be offered to eligible beneficiaries.",Lung_Cancer

"Colon cancers arise only rarely in the course of a pregnancy. Yet colon obstruction, perforation and metastatic spread seem to occur more frequently in this setting than with the average colon cancer. Perhaps this is due to the immunotolerance which accompanies pregnancy. No case of epidermoid (squamous cell) cancer of the colon has been previously described in a pregnant woman. This conjunction has a catastrophic prognosis: the diagnosis of colon tumor is delayed since symptoms are masked by the pregnancy, and epidermoid colon cancer is a particularly aggressive lesion. A major sub-diaphragmatic surgical procedure can be performed with reasonable safety to mother and fetus. Radiotherapy is contraindicated. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy can be administered although the risks to the fetus are not well known. During the first trimester, a therapeutic abortion can be proposed to optimise the treatment of the mother. During the second and third trimesters, treatment of the mother exposes the fetus to the risk of malformations or premature delivery; delay in maternal treatment in hopes of prolonging the pregnancy in order to obtain a viable neonate diminish the chances of maternal survival.",Colon_Cancer
"Two mutations (C228T and C250T) in the promoter region of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) have recently been described in different types of cancer including follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer (TC). In this paper, we reviewed the rates of these mutations in different types and subtypes of TC, their association with a number of clinical and histopathological features and outcome of TC, and their potential diagnostic and prognostic roles in TC. The overall rate of these mutations in TC is about 14 % with least prevalence in the well-differentiated subtypes of papillary thyroid cancer (10-13 %). Their rates increase significantly with increasing aggressiveness of TC reaching about 40 % in the undifferentiated and anaplastic thyroid cancers. There is also clear association with increasing age of patients at the time of diagnosis of TC. The evidence is compelling but with some conflicting results for associations between TERT promoter mutations and tumor size, extrathyroidal invasion, distant metastases, high tumor TNM stage, BRAF (V600E) mutation, recurrence, and mortality. A couple of studies reported a potential diagnostic role for TERT promoter mutations in thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology of fine needle aspiration biopsy. These studies showed 100 % specificity but very low sensitivity of 7-10 %. The sensitivity increases significantly when TERT promoter mutation testing is combined with other gene mutations, particularly BRAF (V600E) and RAS mutations. Although TERT promoter mutations seem to play significant roles in the pathogenesis of TC, the mechanisms by which they contribute to carcinogenesis remain elusive and future work is needed to fully assess the roles, interactions, and impact of these mutations on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics of TC.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Cancer stem cell (CSC) theory states that tumors are organized in a similar hierarchical manner as normal tissues, with a sub-population of tumorigenic stem-like cells that generate the more differentiated nontumorigenic tumor cells. CSCs are chemoresistant and seem to be responsible for tumor recurrence and formation of metastases. Therefore, the study of these cells may lead to crucial advances in the understanding of tumor biology as well as to innovative and more effective therapies. Lung cancer represents the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite improvements in medical and surgical management, patient survival rates remain stable at approximately 15%, calling for innovative strategies that may contribute to improve patient outcome.

"Using the statistical data of 280 prefectural-level cities in China from 2011 to 2020, this paper empirically tests the relationship between digital finance and residents' income in a linear and nonlinear model based on the G-J model theory, respectively. The study aims to discuss and analyze the impact of digital finance development on income distribution in the context of the current situation of digital finance development in China and further explore how to make digital finance better regulate the income distribution of residents. The innovation of this paper is to use two nonlinear methods to verify the Kuznets effect and threshold characteristics of digital financial development affecting the income distribution of residents based on linear analysis and explore the relationship between n digital economic development the current income gap more comprehensively. The study shows a Kuznets effect of digital finance development on the income distribution of Chinese residents. Thus, most regions in China have not yet crossed the inflection point of the bell-shaped curve, and the income gap within areas will continue to increase with the development of digital finance. By constructing a threshold model, it is found that the positive effect of digital finance on income disparity may initially increase with the increase of regional economic level. Still, when the regional economic development reaches a higher stage, the effect will tend to fall back. As a result, the negative impact of digital finance development on residents' income distribution will be significantly reduced at that time.",Generic
"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Trends in lung cancer incidence show increases among women and in developing countries, attributed to increased tobacco use.

"The use of laparoscopic surgery to treat colon cancer has been well studied; however, the specific use of laparoscopic colectomy for Dukes A colon cancer has not been evaluated. The data of laparoscopic colectomy were compared with those of conventional open colectomy, and the surgical results of patients who underwent surgery for Dukes A colon cancer were evaluated. Between November 1993 and October 1997, 20 patients underwent laparoscopic colectomy for Dukes A colon cancer. Operation time, blood loss, first passage of flatus, day of resumption of oral intake, length of hospital stay after surgery, and number of dissected lymph nodes were compared between 20 patients who underwent laparoscopic colectomy and 23 patients who underwent conventional open colectomy for Dukes A colon cancer. In patients with laparoscopic colectomy, when compared with those with conventional open colectomy, mean blood loss was less (103 g vs. 318 g), flatus returned more quickly (3.5 days vs. 4.2 days), oral intake resumed earlier (3.7 days vs. 4.7 days), and postoperative hospital stay was shorter (16.4 days vs. 24.6 days). The mean number of dissected lymph nodes was not different between the two groups (9.2 vs. 9.2 for D2 dissection). No patient had port-site metastasis or recurrence during a follow-up period from 13 to 60 months (median, 38 months). Review of the literature and the authors' findings indicated that none of the 142 reported patients had port-site metastasis after laparoscopic colectomy for Dukes A colon cancer.

CT findings were recorded following general rules for clinical and pathological studies on cancer of colon, rectum and anus, proposed by Japanese Society for Cancer of Colon and Rectum. 1) Tumors were detected in 90% of advanced colon cancers. 2) Sensitivity in local extension (S factor) was 58.0%. 3) Sensitivity in lymph node involvement (N factor) was 50.0%. 4) Sensitivity in final staging diagnosis, dividing colon cancer into two groups below st II and above st III, was 63.3%. 5) Further study should be necessitated to provide useful information for preoperative staging diagnosis of colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Deep learning is a class of machine learning methods that are gaining success and attracting interest in many domains, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and playing games. Deep learning methods produce a mapping from raw inputs to desired outputs (eg, image classes). Unlike traditional machine learning methods, which require hand-engineered feature extraction from inputs, deep learning methods learn these features directly from data. With the advent of large datasets and increased computing power, these methods can produce models with exceptional performance. These models are multilayer artificial neural networks, loosely inspired by biologic neural systems. Weighted connections between nodes (neurons) in the network are iteratively adjusted based on example pairs of inputs and target outputs by back-propagating a corrective error signal through the network. For computer vision tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be effective. Recently, several clinical applications of CNNs have been proposed and studied in radiology for classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. This article reviews the key concepts of deep learning for clinical radiologists, discusses technical requirements, describes emerging applications in clinical radiology, and outlines limitations and future directions in this field. Radiologists should become familiar with the principles and potential applications of deep learning in medical imaging. RSNA, 2017.",Generic
"Targeted therapies inhibiting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been introduced in the treatment of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Many inhibitors of the EGFR have been developed, targeting either the extracellular receptor domain with antibodies or the intracellular tyrosine kinase binding domain with small molecules. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) gefitinib (Iressa) was the first targeted drug to be registered for the treatment of NSCLC after failure of chemotherapy. Given concurrently together with platinum combination chemotherapy both TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib (Tarceva) failed to increase activity. Sequential targeted therapy after chemotherapy is currently being investigated further. Studies with the monoclonal antibody cetuximab (Erbitux) combined with chemotherapy are ongoing. Side effects of the small molecules are mainly skin rash and diarrhea, whereas the antibodies do not give diarrhea. Selection of patients, based on molecular markers and patient characteristics, has become an important issue for the further development of these drugs, given there is activity in a relatively small group of patients with NSCLC. Newer drugs inhibiting more than one receptor pathway are being investigated in order to find activity in a broader group of patients.",Lung_Cancer
"In recent years, cancer genomics has provided new insights into genetic alterations and signaling pathways involved in thyroid cancer. However, the picture of the molecular landscape is not yet complete. DNA methylation, the most widely studied epigenetic mechanism, is altered in thyroid cancer. Recent technological advances have allowed the identification of novel differentially methylated regions, methylation signatures and potential biomarkers. However, despite recent progress in cataloging methylation alterations in thyroid cancer, many questions remain unanswered. The aim of this review is to comprehensively examine the current knowledge on DNA methylation in thyroid cancer and discuss its potential clinical applications. After providing a general overview of DNA methylation and its dysregulation in cancer, we carefully describe the aberrant methylation changes in thyroid cancer and relate them to methylation patterns, global hypomethylation and gene-specific alterations. We hope this review helps to accelerate the use of the diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential of DNA methylation for the benefit of thyroid cancer patients.",Thyroid_Cancer

"In the interval 1979-1988, out of 1070 operated goiters 77 malignant thyroid tumors were recorded, 60 of them being differentiated: papillary--32 (53.4%), vesicular--12 (20%), mixed forms--16 (26.7%). The differentiated thyroid carcinomas had peculiar clinical biological and prognostic features and were framed: stage I--60%, stage II--23.4% and state III-IV--16.6%. Only 15 cases presented lymph node metastases. In 16 cases the thyroid tumor was associated with another thyropathy: Hashimoto's thyroiditis--5 cases, Basedow's disease--1 case. The surgical intervention was performed in two times: first total lobectomy or total lobo-isthmectomy [correction of lobioistectomy] with contralateral subtotal exeresis, then total thyroidectomy.

"The implication of iron in the pathophysiology of colorectal cancer is documented at both the biochemical and epidemiological levels. Iron chelators are therefore useful molecular tools for the study and potential treatment of this type of cancer characterized by high incidence and mortality rates. We report a novel prochelation strategy that utilizes a disulfide redox switch to connect a thiosemicarbazone iron-binding unit with carbohydrate moieties targeting the increased expression of glucose transporters in colorectal cancer cells. We synthesized three glycoconjugates (GA2TC4, G6TC4, and M6TC4) with different connectivity and/or carbohydrate moieties, as well as an aglycone analog (ATC4). The sugar conjugates present increased solubility in neutral aqueous solutions, and the ester-linked conjugates M6TC4 and G6TC4 compete as effectively as d-glucose for transporter-mediated cellular uptake. The glycoconjugates show improved selectivity compared to the aglycone analog and are 6-11 times more toxic in Caco-2 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells than in normal CCD18-co colon fibroblasts.",Colon_Cancer

"Proton therapy is an emerging radiotherapy technology with the potential to improve the therapeutic index in the treatment of lung cancer patients. Since charged particles, such as protons, have a penetration length that can be modified by using different energies, protons offer the clinician the ability to modulate radiation dose deposition along the beam path. This facilitates an increase of the dose to the tumor target while minimizing the volume of normal tissue irradiation. Such precise delivery is particularly relevant in the setting of lung cancer where the targeted tissues are in close proximity to moderately radiation-sensitive organs like the spinal cord, heart, and esophagus, but are also effectively surrounded by the normal lung, which is extremely sensitive to radiation damage. Proton therapy has been investigated for the treatment of surgically curable yet medically inoperable patients as well as patients with regionally advanced disease.",Lung_Cancer
"Immune checkpoint blockers have transformed non-small-cell lung cancer treatment, but they can lead to autoimmune and inflammatory side effects, leading to the concurrent use of immunosuppressive treatments. In this analysis, we delve into the potential of antibodies checkpoint blockade, focusing on CTLA-4 inhibition using ipilimumab, as a groundbreaking cancer immunotherapy. We also concentrate on the role of biomarkers, particularly PD-L1 activity and mutation significance, in predicting the response to programmed cell death protein 1 blockage and the prevalence of side effects associated with immune-related side effects. In describing the patterns of cancer response to immunotherapy, we underline the limitations of response assessment criteria like RECIST and World Health Organization.

"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a neuroendocrine cancer that originates from calcitonin-secreting parafollicular cells, or C cells. We found that Cdk5 and its cofactors p35 and p25 are highly expressed in human MTC and that Cdk5 activity promotes MTC proliferation. A conditional MTC mouse model was generated and corroborated the role of aberrant Cdk5 activation in MTC. C cell-specific overexpression of p25 caused rapid C cell hyperplasia leading to lethal MTC, which was arrested by repressing p25 overexpression. A comparative phosphoproteomic screen between proliferating and arrested MTC identified the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) as a crucial Cdk5 downstream target. Prevention of Rb phosphorylation at Ser807/Ser811 attenuated MTC proliferation. These findings implicate Cdk5 signaling via Rb as critical to MTC tumorigenesis and progression.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Lung cancer is a highly malignant disease with poor prognosis, most cases are diagnosed at a very late stage. More effective medications or therapies should be developed to improve its prognosis. The advancement of tumor immunity and tumor immunosuppression facilitated the feasibility of immunotherapies for lung cancer. Ipilimumab, antibody to Programmed death-1 (PD-1), Toll-like receptor agonists, liposomal BLP25 (L- BLP25), belagenpumatucel-L, melanoma-associated antigen A3 (MAGE-A3) vaccine and talactoferrin have been proved to be effective for lung cancer through early clinical trials, most of the drugs have moved forward to phase III trials, so as to collect much higher level evidence to support the immunotherapies incorporated into the multidisciplinary treatment of lung cancer. The selection of target patients at appropriate stages, breaking down of tumor immunosuppression as well as the objective measurement of tumor response to the therapy are major challenges for the development of immunotherapies for lung cancer. The clarifying of the mechanism of immune escape led to the above drug development, and immune-senescence has already become the hotspot in this field.",Lung_Cancer
"The splicing of pre-mRNAs into mature transcripts is remarkable for its precision, but the mechanisms by which the cellular machinery achieves such specificity are incompletely understood. Here, we describe a deep neural network that accurately predicts splice junctions from an arbitrary pre-mRNA transcript sequence, enabling precise prediction of noncoding genetic variants that cause cryptic splicing. Synonymous and intronic mutations with predicted splice-altering consequence validate at a high rate on RNA-seq and are strongly deleterious in the human population. De novo mutations with predicted splice-altering consequence are significantly enriched in patients with autism and intellectual disability compared to healthy controls and validate against RNA-seq in 21 out of 28 of these patients. We estimate that 9%-11% of pathogenic mutations in patients with rare genetic disorders are caused by this previously underappreciated class of disease variation.",Generic

"A synthetic prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) analogue, misoprostol, was investigated for its effects on the growth of colon cancer in two in vivo models. Human colon cancer cell lines C170, LIM2412 and LIM2405 were grown as subcutaneous xenografts on T-lymphocyte deficient ARC(s) nu/nu mice. Tumour volumes were found to be significantly inhibited compared with control in misoprostol-treated animals with two cell lines. C170 was inhibited by 70.5% (P = 0.0001) and LIM2412 by 68.2% (P = 0.01). LIM2405 was inhibited by 33% (P = 0.14) which was not significantly different from the control. In a second experiment, colon cancers were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats using 1,2 dimethyl-hydrazine (DMH). After 10 weeks of treatment, rats were randomized to receive a 5 week course of 20 micrograms/kg per day of oral misoprostol. Misoprostol-treated rats were found to have a similar tumour incidence and staging compared with control animals. Oral administration of misoprostol has an inhibitory effect on early tumour growth of some colonic cancers, but not on established tumours.",Colon_Cancer
"The concept that cancer might arise from a rare population of cells with stem cell-like properties was proposed 150 years ago. Increasing evidence during the past 2 decades suggests the existence of a small subgroup of cells in cancer that are responsible for tumor growth and proliferation. Stem cells have self-renewing properties; thus, they are appealing candidates for generating the malignant phenotype. Although the concept of stem cells in leukemia has received significant attention for more than the past decade, over the past several years, expression of several surface markers on cancer cells has led to identification of tumor-initiating cells in several solid tumors, including melanoma, brain, breast, prostate, liver, pancreatic, ovarian, and recently, colon cancer.

"A significant obstacle for the management of patients with colorectal cancer is intrinsic drug resistance or in patients that respond to chemotherapy, acquired drug resistance. Drug resistance can occur through a variety of mechanisms. These include alterations in drug influx, drug efflux, intracellular metabolic activation, intracellular catabolism, through alterations in the drug's target or through numerous changes downstream of the target including alterations in genes involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis or in DNA damage repair. In this article, the mechanisms of action and the mechanisms of resistance to the fluoropyrimidines are reviewed focusing on newer studies using tumor samples obtained from patients. Clinical trials that can potentially overcome the relevant mechanisms of resistance are described.",Colon_Cancer

"The PEAK family pseudokinases are essential components of tyrosine kinase (TK) pathways that regulate cell growth and adhesion; however, their role in human cancer remains unclear. Here, we report an oncogenic activity of the pseudokinase PEAK2 in colorectal cancer (CRC). Notably, high PRAG1 expression, which encodes PEAK2, was associated with a bad prognosis in CRC patients. Functionally, PEAK2 depletion reduced CRC cell growth and invasion in vitro, while its overexpression increased these transforming effects. PEAK2 depletion also reduced CRC development in nude mice. Mechanistically, PEAK2 expression induced cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation, despite its catalytic inactivity. Phosphoproteomic analysis identified regulators of cell adhesion and F-actin dynamics as PEAK2 targets. Additionally, PEAK2 was identified as a novel ABL TK activator. In line with this, PEAK2 expression localized at focal adhesions of CRC cells and induced ABL-dependent formation of actin-rich plasma membrane protrusions filopodia that function to drive cell invasion. Interestingly, all these PEAK2 transforming activities were regulated by its main phosphorylation site, Tyr413, which implicates the SRC oncogene. Thus, our results uncover a protumoural function of PEAK2 in CRC and suggest that its deregulation affects adhesive properties of CRC cells to enable cancer progression.",Colon_Cancer
"An estimated 180,000 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. this year, and lung cancer accounts for approximately 25% of all cancer deaths. Most lung cancers are initially detected on chest radiographs, but many benign lesions have radiologic characteristics similar to malignant lesions. Thus, additional studies are required for further evaluation. CT is most frequently used to provide additional anatomic and morphologic information about lesions, but it is limited in distinguishing between benign and malignant abnormalities. Because of the indeterminate results obtained from anatomic images, biopsy procedures, including thoracoscopy and thoracotomy, may be used even though one half of the lesions removed are benign and do not need to be removed. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging provides physiologic and metabolic information that characterizes lesions that are indeterminate by CT, accurately stages the distribution of lung cancer and provides prognostic information. FDG PET imaging takes advantage of the increased accumulation of FDG in transformed cells and is sensitive (approximately 95%) to the detection of cancer in patients who have indeterminate lesions on CT. The specificity (approximately 85%) of PET imaging is slightly less than its sensitivity because some inflammatory processes, such as active granulomatous infections, avidly accumulate FDG. The high negative predictive value of PET suggests that lesions considered negative on the study are benign, biopsy is not needed and radiographic follow-up is recommended. Several studies have documented the increased accuracy of PET compared with CT in the evaluation of the hilar and mediastinal lymph-node status in patients with lung cancer. Whole-body PET studies detect metastatic disease that is unsuspected by conventional imaging and demonstrate some of the anatomic abnormalities detected by CT to be benign lesions. Management changes have been reported in up to 41% of patients on the basis of the results of whole-body studies.",Lung_Cancer

"Lung cancer is the leading cause of global cancer incidence and mortality, accounting for an estimated 2 million diagnoses and 1.8 million deaths. Neoplasms of the lungs are the second most common cancer diagnosis in men and women (after prostate and breast cancer, respectively). With increasing access to tobacco and industrialization in developing nations, lung cancer incidence is rising globally. The average age of diagnosis is 70 years old. Men are twice as likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer, which largely reflects differences in tobacco consumption, although women may be more susceptible due to higher proportions of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations and the effects of oestrogen. African American men in the US are at the highest risk of lung cancer. Family history increases risk by 1.7-fold, with a greater risk among first-degree relatives. Tobacco smoking is the greatest preventable cause of death worldwide, accounting for up to 90% of lung cancer cases, and continued consumption is projected to increase global cancer incidence, particularly in developing nations such as China, Russia, and India. Second-hand smoke among children and spouses has likewise been implicated. Radon from natural underground uranium decay is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the developed world.

"Clinical professionals may not have the necessary evidence-based knowledge regarding specific leadership styles to succeed in a leadership role. This article examines the various leadership styles that can be adopted by a clinical professional who transitions into a leadership role. The Path-Goal theory developed by Robert House in 1971 was used as the theoretical lens for this study. Twenty scholarly, peer-reviewed articles written in English and published between 2015 and 2020 were analyzed and synthesized to develop the findings. The findings showed that employee retention was positively associated with transformational and authentic leadership styles; organizational commitment was positively associated with transformational, transactional, and authentic leadership styles; and job satisfaction was positively associated with transformational and authentic leadership styles. In particular, a transformational leadership style demonstrated higher rates of employee retention and job satisfaction than did transactional and laissez-faire leadership styles. The authentic and transformational leadership styles each saw increased job satisfaction and commitment, but a correlation between the authentic leadership style and those benefits was less evident. Clinical professionals should apply the transformational leadership style to become effective leaders.",Generic

"General factors affecting the prognosis of thyroid cancer are age and sex of the patient. The size of the primary tumour seems to be unimportant whilst the thyroid capsule is intact. Distant metastases shorten the survival time, whereas in cases of differentiated carcinoma cervical lymph node have no prognostic influence. A combined therapy of near-total thyroidectomy, 131-J-treatment, and TSH-suppression therapy using thyroid hormones is most successful. Additional external radiation seems to exert some positive effects in special cases. The cell-type has a great prognostic influence irrespective of the above mentioned variables. Papillary carcinoma has the best prognosis with a 5-yrs and 10-yrs survival rate of 86% or 78% respectively.

"Colorectal cancer, which is one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, has a slow natural history that provides a great opportunity for prevention strategies. Plant-derived natural products have received considerable attention because of their inherent colorectal cancer chemopreventive effects. The plant lectin jacalin specifically recognizes the tumor-associated Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen and has antiproliferative effects on human colon cancer cells, highlighting its potential antitumor activity. To evaluate jacalin's potential application in colorectal cancer chemoprevention, we studied its effects on the early stages of carcinogenesis. Balb/c mice were given 4 intrarectal deposits of 0.1 ml solution of Methyl-N'-Nitro-N-Nitroso-Guanidine (5 mg/ml) twice a week (with a 3-day interval) for 2 weeks. Starting 2 weeks before carcinogen administration, animals were treated orally with jacalin (0.5 and 25 g) three times a week (on alternate weekdays) for 10 weeks. We show that jacalin treatment reduced the number of preneoplastic lesions in carcinogen-exposed mice. This anticarcinogenic activity was associated with decreased colonic epithelial cell proliferation and stromal COX-2 expression and with increased intestinal production of TNF- .

The present study was designed to investigate the effect of genistein on azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon carcinogenesis and to study its modulatory role on the levels of activity of 8-isoprostane, cyclooxygenase (COX), and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin F2alpha dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) in the colonic mucosa and colon tumors of male F344 rats. At 5 weeks of age, groups of male F344 rats were fed control (AIN-76A) diet or a diet containing 250 ppm genistein. Beginning 2 weeks later, all animals except those in the vehicle-treated groups were given weekly s.c. injections of AOM (15 mg/kg body weight) for 2 successive weeks. All rats were continued on their respective dietary regimen for 52 weeks after AOM treatment and were then sacrificed. Colon tumors were evaluated histopathologically. Colonic mucosae and tumors were analyzed for COX, 15-PGDH, and 8-isoprostane levels. Administration of genistein significantly increased noninvasive and total adenocarcinoma multiplicity (P 0.05). Also, genistein significantly inhibited the 15-PGDH activity (>35%) and levels of 8-iosoprostane (50%) in colonic mucosa and in tumors. In contrast, genistein had no significant effect on the COX synthetic activity, as measured by the rate of formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane B2 from [14C]arachidonic acid. The results of this investigation emphasize that the biological effects of genistein may be organ specific, inhibiting cancer development in some sites yet showing no effect or an enhancing effect on the tumorigenesis at other sites, such as the colon. The inhibition of 8-isoprostane levels by genistein indicates its possible antioxidant potential, which is independent of the observed colon tumor enhancement, yet this agent may also possess several biological effects that overshadow its antioxidant potential. The exact mechanism(s) of colon tumor enhancement by genistein remain to be elucidated; it is likely that its colon tumor-enhancing effects may, at least in part, be related to inhibition of prostaglandin catabolic enzyme activities.",Colon_Cancer
"Altered cyclin-dependent kinase activity is observed in many human malignancies. Cyclin-dependent kinases that promote cell cycle progression may be promising targets in the treatment of cancer. The therapeutic effects of roniciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor for medullary thyroid cancer were investigated in the present study. Roniciclib inhibited medullary thyroid cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Roniciclib induced caspase-3 activity and contributed to apoptosis. Cell cycle progression was arrested in the G2 phase. In vivo, roniciclib treatment retarded the growth of tumors of medullary thyroid cancer xenografts. In addition, roniciclib in combination with sorafenib was more effective than either single treatment in a xenograft model. No morbidity was observed in animals treated with single roniciclib therapy and combination treatment of roniciclib and sorafenib. These data provide a rationale for clinical assessment of using roniciclib in the treatment of patients with medullary thyroid cancer.",Thyroid_Cancer
"In thyroid nodule management, ultrasound (US) features, such as hypoechogenicity of the lesion, irregular margins, microcalcifications, and intralesional vascular signal, alone or combined, have to be considered as suggestive for malignancy. Because of the low prevalence of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), a few papers analyzed US characteristics associated with this cancer in small series, with controversial results. Aim of this study was to evaluate in MTC the US risk factors of thyroid nodule. In this order, a series of nodules histologically proven as MTC and a group of nodules with histology of papillary cancer (PTC) were retrospectively compared with a control group of benign nodule. Fifty percent MTC were solid hypoechoic and 16% showed microcalcifications with significant difference with respect to the benign group (p<0.05 for both parameters), while no significant difference was recorded regarding margins nor nodular vascularization. The presence of at least one US risk feature was almost equal in MTC (58.3%) and controls (55.5%). On the contrary, at least one US risk factor was significantly (p<0.001) more frequent in PTC than in benign group or MTC series. This study showed low frequency of ultrasound features associated to PTC when analyzed in medullary cancer. Because of the poor literature focusing on this topic, and the herein used design, these data contribute to the knowledge about presentation of MTC at US. We advice for further prospective studies on larger series to define the US presentation of this cancer type.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Thyroid cancer is the most common type of endocrine cancer, and its prevalence continue to rise. Non-metastatic thyroid cancer patients are successfully treated. However, looking for new therapeutic strategies is of great importance for metastatic thyroid cancers that still lead to death. With respect to this, the tumor microenvironment (TME), which plays a key role in tumor progression, should be considered as a new promising therapeutic target to hamper thyroid cancer progression. Indeed, thyroid tumors consist of cancer cells and a heterogeneous and ever-changing niche, represented by the TME, which contributes to establishing most of the features of cancer cells. The TME consists of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, soluble factors, metabolites, blood and lymphatic tumor vessels and several stromal cell types that, by interacting with each other and with tumor cells, affect TME remodeling, cancer growth and progression. Among the thyroid TME components, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have gained more attention in the last years. Indeed, recent important evidence showed that thyroid CAFs strongly sustain thyroid cancer growth and progression by producing soluble factors and ECM proteins, which, in turn, deeply affect thyroid cancer cell behavior and aggressiveness. Hence, in this article, we describe the thyroid TME, focusing on the desmoplastic stromal reaction, which is a powerful indicator of thyroid cancer progression and an invasive growth pattern. In addition, we discuss the origins and features of the thyroid CAFs, their influence on thyroid cancer growth and progression, their role in remodeling the ECM and their immune-modulating functions. We finally debate therapeutic perspectives targeting CAFs.",Thyroid_Cancer
"There have been no life-prolonging effects of surgical adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, so surgical resection has been considered a standard therapy for colorectal cancer. Recently, clinical trials of modulation therapy with 5-FU and leucovorin showed higher efficacies in advanced colorectal cancer, and significant prolongations of survival time and disease-free interval were reported in a randomized trial of 5-FU and leucovorin for postoperative adjuvant therapy of resected colon cancer. Moreover, in a scientifically well controlled randomized study with 5-FU and levamisole, the significance of this regimen for Dukes C colon cancer has been shown for standard adjuvant chemotherapy.",Colon_Cancer
"It has been hypothesised that clinically evident lung cancers have accumulated many different genetic or epigenetic abnormalities in oncogenes and/or tumour suppressor genes. This notion has important clinical ramifications. Recent developments in our knowledge of the molecular biology of lung cancer are reviewed, with particular reference to genetic abnormalities in tumour suppressor gene inactivation and overactivity of growth promoting oncogenes. These changes lead to the ""hallmarks of lung cancer"". These hallmarks are the new rational targets for early detection, prevention, and treatment of lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer
"Numerous occupational and environmental exposures have been shown to disrupt thyroid hormones, but much less is known about their relationships with thyroid cancer. Here we review the epidemiology studies of occupations and occupational exposures and thyroid cancer incidence to provide insight into preventable risk factors for thyroid cancer. The published literature was searched using the Web of Knowledge database for all articles through August 2013 that had in their text 'occupation' 'job' 'employment' or 'work' and 'thyroid cancer'. After excluding 10 mortality studies and 4 studies with less than 5 exposed incident cases, we summarised the findings of 30 articles that examined thyroid cancer incidence in relation to occupations or occupational exposure. The studies were grouped by exposure/occupation category, study design and exposure assessment approach. Where available, gender-stratified results are reported. The most studied (19 of 30 studies) and the most consistent associations were observed for radiation-exposed workers and healthcare occupations. Suggestive, but inconsistent, associations were observed in studies of pesticide-exposed workers and agricultural occupations. Findings for other exposures and occupation groups were largely null. The majority of studies had few exposed cases and assessed exposure based on occupation or industry category, self-report, or generic (population-based) job exposure matrices. The suggestive, but inconsistent findings for many of the occupational exposures reviewed here indicate that more studies with larger numbers of cases and better exposure assessment are necessary, particularly for exposures known to disrupt thyroid homeostasis.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Recent insights into anti-tumor immunotherapy have led to a wave of clinical trials involving immunotherapy for lung cancer. Vaccines have evolved from nonspecific immune stimulants, like Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), to much more specific and potent strategies, some of which generate active immune responses against tumor-associated antigens. Understanding the mechanisms of anti-tumor immunity and identifying target antigens will likely improve these therapeutic strategies and provide them with a niche in the future of lung cancer therapy.",Lung_Cancer

"The clinical and morphological aspects of occult sclerosing carcinoma of the thyroid are presented on the basis of a ten-year review of the surgically removed thyroids in Geneva and from the study of thyroid glands obtained from 133 consecutive autopsies. The 15 cases found in the surgical material represented 7.7% of all malignant thyroid tumours and one fifth of the papillary carcinomas. Occult tumours are found at a mean age of 46.6 years and predominate in women. Clinically, two thirds presented as nodular goiters, two cases as primary hyperplasia and one as primary hyperparathyroidism. Three out of 15 cases presented clinically with a cervical lymph node metastasis. Treatment was conservative in all cases and consisted of subtotal thyroidectomy and/or elective lymphadenectomy, followed by medical suppression of TSH. Follow-up in 11 cases showed a single recurrence in a cervical lymph node, while the other 10 cases have been disease free for 4 to 13 years. In the autopsy series 3 thyroid glands (2.3%) contained occult tumours, two of which were microcarcinomas. The Genevan series compares with other European and American studies but differs from the much higher incidence in the Japanese.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The nervous system is a product of evolution. That is, it was constructed through a long series of modifications, within the strong constraints of heredity, and continuously subjected to intense selection pressures. As a result, the organization and functions of the brain are shaped by its history. We believe that this fact, underappreciated in contemporary systems neuroscience, offers an invaluable aid for helping us resolve the brain's mysteries. Indeed, we think that the consideration of evolutionary history ought to take its place alongside other intellectual tools used to understand the brain, such as behavioural experiments, studies of anatomical structure and functional characterization based on recordings of neural activity. In this introduction, we argue for the importance of evolution by highlighting specific examples of ways that evolutionary theory can enhance neuroscience. The rest of the theme issue elaborates this point, emphasizing the conservative nature of neural evolution, the important consequences of specific transitions that occurred in our history, and the ways in which considerations of evolution can shed light on issues ranging from specific mechanisms to fundamental principles of brain organization. This article is part of the theme issue 'Systems neuroscience through the lens of evolutionary theory'.",Generic
"Tumors evolve in close interaction with their microenvironment, which encompasses a continual tension between the developing tumor and the host immune system. Clinical trials have shown that appropriate enhancement of a tumor immune response can lead to long-lasting clinical responses and patient benefit. Understanding the contribution of the immune contexture, in addition to the molecular subtype across different tumor indications, is a significant knowledge gap with limited sagacity to drive rational immunotherapy combinations. To better inform clinical studies, we must first strive to understand the multifaceted elements of the tumor-immune interaction, the spatiotemporal interplay of numerous different immune cell types, in conjunction with an understanding of the oncogenic drivers and mutations that may lead to presentation of neoepitopes and could drive changes within the tumor microenvironment. In this review, we discuss the Immunoscore and its probable universal characteristic. The overlay of immune quantification with the molecular segments of disease and how this may benefit identification of patients at high risk of tumor recurrence will be discussed. The Immunoscore may translate to provide a tumor agnostic method to define immune fitness of a given tumor and predict and stratify patients who will benefit from certain therapies (in particular immune therapies) and, ultimately, help save the lives of patients with cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Metastatic development is the primary cause of cancer treatment failure and is responsible for most deaths from colorectal cancer. For the majority of patients, by the time primary colorectal cancers are diagnosed, sub-clinical or clinically relevant liver metastases have already occurred. The formation of liver metastases represents a highly selective sequence in which a subpopulation of cells, within a tumour, express genes that allow them to progress through distinct steps and spread to distant organs. Modification of gene expression in these cells leads to transformation, growth, angiogenesis, invasion, dissemination, survival in systemic circulation and attachment in the organ of metastases. Existing therapies directed at metastatic disease of the liver have had minimal impact on outcome. Contemporary treatment regimens are not likely to significantly alter the natural history of liver metastases. Consequently, understanding the molecular and biological mechanisms of colorectal cancer may allow for the development of therapeutic strategies designed to prevent and treat liver metastases. Standard chemotherapy regimens have had only minimal success in effectively treating metastatic colorectal cancer. This review focuses on the molecular and biological mechanisms of colorectal cancer angiogenesis. In addition, this report will evaluate the novel antiangiogenic therapeutic strategies targeting colorectal cancer and hepatic metastases.",Colon_Cancer

"A 62-year-old man had been followed because of an elevated serum level of carcinoembryonic antigen without the detection of any cancer lesions. However, there was a sudden increase in the serum level of carcinoembryonic antigen, and abdominal imagings showed a hepatic tumor with peripheral intrahepatic bile duct dilatation, and a submucosal tumor at the sigmoid colon with intact mucosa. Histopathological findings showed that the hepatic tumor had perineural invasion, suggesting an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and that the colon tumor infiltrated the submucosa, while its mucosa was intact. Both tumors showed similar pathological features and were positive for cytokeratin 20 and 7. These findings suggested intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with metastatic sigmoid colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer

"A significant obstacle for the successful management of patients with colorectal cancer is intrinsic drug resistance or, in patients who respond to chemotherapy, acquired drug resistance. Drug resistance can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including alterations in drug influx, drug efflux, intracellular metabolic activation, and intracellular catabolism, or through alterations in the drug's target. In addition, alterations in genes involved in the regulation of the cell cycle or in DNA damage repair may result in a cell becoming resistant to chemotherapy. In this chapter, the mechanisms of action and the mechanisms of resistance to the fluoropyrimidines and raltitrexed (Tomudex; Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE) are reviewed, focusing on newer studies using gastric and colorectal tumor samples obtained from patients.

Castellone and colleagues showed that prostaglandin E2 modulates the beta-catenin signaling axis, a key pathway for colorectal tumorigenesis. Holla and colleagues showed that prostaglandin E2 might act via a nuclear receptor. These findings shed light on the mechanisms that underlie prostaglandin action, and provide a molecular framework for developing future treatments for colorectal cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Molecular genetics analyses have indicated that approximately 55% of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) tumors bear activating mutations of the RET gene, including inherited and sporadic cases. Tumoral RET mutations, especially M918T, have a strong negative prognostic impact. RET is the most important target for recent systemic therapy trials of MTC, along with vascular endothelial growth factor receptors. This review discusses promising recent clinical trials data for multikinase inhibitors including motesanib, vandetanib, sunitinib, sorafenib, and cabozantinib/XL184. Across multiple studies reported to date, RET mutations, although prevalent in these subjects, have not proven so far to predict whether patients will respond to multikinase inhibitors. In addition to comparing available data for efficacy and toxicity of these agents, the review focuses on critical questions related to appropriate selection of MTC patients for systemic treatment, and how best to integrate these therapies with established modalities of surgery and radiation therapy.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Smoking cigarettes has been consistently associated with adenomatous polyps. However, only a few studies have reported associations between smoking cigarettes or using other forms of tobacco and colon cancer. A population-based case-control study of colon cancer was conducted in 3 areas in the United States: northern California, Utah and Minnesota. We observed approximately a 50% increase in colon cancer risk from smoking over a pack of cigarettes per day among both men and women. Those who stopped smoking remained at increased risk, even if they stopped over 10 years ago. Our data suggest that the amount smoked may be a more important factor than the total number of years smoked. Smoking neither cigars nor pipes was associated with an increased risk of colon cancer. Among female participants only, those who smoked over 20 cigarettes per day and had a large body mass index were at greater risk of colon cancer than participants who smoked the same amount but were smaller (p for interaction among women = 0.04).",Colon_Cancer

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a general term that implies the use of a computer to model intelligent behavior with minimal human intervention. AI is generally accepted as having started with the invention of robots. The term derives from the Czech word robota, meaning biosynthetic machines used as forced labor. In this field, Leonardo Da Vinci's lasting heritage is today's burgeoning use of robotic-assisted surgery, named after him, for complex urologic and gynecologic procedures. Da Vinci's sketchbooks of robots helped set the stage for this innovation. AI, described as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, was officially born in 1956. The term is applicable to a broad range of items in medicine such as robotics, medical diagnosis, medical statistics, and human biology-up to and including today's ""omics"". AI in medicine, which is the focus of this review, has two main branches: virtual and physical. The virtual branch includes informatics approaches from deep learning information management to control of health management systems, including electronic health records, and active guidance of physicians in their treatment decisions. The physical branch is best represented by robots used to assist the elderly patient or the attending surgeon. Also embodied in this branch are targeted nanorobots, a unique new drug delivery system. The societal and ethical complexities of these applications require further reflection, proof of their medical utility, economic value, and development of interdisciplinary strategies for their wider application.",Generic
"Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) accounts for 5-10% of all thyroid cancers. The majority of medullary thyroid cancers are sporadic, but 25% of cases are inherited as a result of germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. In sporadic cases MTC presents as a thyroid nodule discovered at palpation or at thyroid ultrasonography, and is indistinguishable from thyroid nodules of different histology. Since effective treatment of MTC is only possible when the tumour is limited to the thyroid gland, early discovery has a decisive impact on how radical initial surgical treatment needs to be. Recent data suggest that in sporadic cases, early discovery of thyroid nodular disease is possible when screening serum calcitonin measurement, while screening for germline RET proto-oncogene mutations is fundamental in first degree relatives of patients with hereditary MTC.",Thyroid_Cancer

Using specific external cell surface labeling techniques, we have broadened our investigation of tumor cell surface glycoconjugates to include studies on cultured human epithelial cells from fetal intestine and from colonic carcinoma. We have isolated by affinity chromatography and gel filtration and integral membrane glycoprotein, termed Galactoprotein I, from a cultured human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line, which appears to be identical in many respects to CEA.

This narrative review aims to explain the association between these two entities, focusing on insulin resistance as the mediator and exploring the effects of antidiabetic agents on thyroid cancer incidence and progression.We searched Pubmed for English-written articles on insulin resistance, diabetes, antidiabetic treatments, and thyroid cancer reported from January 2019 to April 2023. Exclusion criteria were preclinical and clinical studies involving a population with thyroid dysfunction, benign nodular goiter, or those that only analyzed thyroid cancer's association with obesity.The results of the narrative literature review revealed 96 articles. Additionally, four studies from a manual search were retrieved. After the exclusion criteria were applied, we included 20 studies. Out of 8 studies on insulin-resistant or Metabolic Syndrome patients, all suggest a positive association with thyroid cancer. At the same time, for diabetes, four out of five publications support a link with thyroid cancer. The seven remaining studies on antidiabetics suggest that metformin might benefit thyroid cancer. In contrast, the evidence for an association between Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and increased thyroid cancer findings is limited.In conclusion, the association between thyroid cancer and diabetes may be explained by insulin resistance, as shown in observational studies.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) has given the electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinicians reading them super-human diagnostic abilities. Trained without hard-coded rules by finding often subclinical patterns in huge datasets, AI transforms the ECG, a ubiquitous, non-invasive cardiac test that is integrated into practice workflows, into a screening tool and predictor of cardiac and non-cardiac diseases, often in asymptomatic individuals. This review describes the mathematical background behind supervised AI algorithms, and discusses selected AI ECG cardiac screening algorithms including those for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction, episodic atrial fibrillation from a tracing recorded during normal sinus rhythm, and other structural and valvular diseases. The ability to learn from big data sets, without the need to understand the biological mechanism, has created opportunities for detecting non-cardiac diseases as COVID-19 and introduced challenges with regards to data privacy.

Finally, with mobile form factors that allow acquisition of medical-grade ECGs from smartphones and wearables, the use of AI may enable massive scalability to democratize healthcare.",Generic
"In the last decade remarkable progress has been made in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer due to the introduction of oxaliplatin and irinotecan in clinical practice. The addition of biological agents seems to offer a chance to further enhance the activity of conventional chemotherapy.

Cetuximab in combination with irinotecan has been registered in the USA and Europe for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer expressing the EGFR after failure of prior irinotecan-based cytotoxic therapy. The role of cetuximab in first-line therapy is still investigational. Some phase II trials assessing cetuximab plus chemotherapy demonstrated a high objective response rate and promising results in terms of time to progression and overall survival; data from phase III trials are pending.

"Classical Non-homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway is the mainstay of cellular response to DNA double strand breaks. While aberrant expression of genes involved in this pathway has been linked with genomic instability and drug resistance in several cancers, limited information is available about its clinical significance in colon cancer. We performed a comprehensive analysis of seven essential genes, including XRCC5, XRCC6, PRKDC, LIG4, XRCC4, NHEJ1, and PAXX of this pathway, in colon cancer using multi-omics datasets, and studied their associations with molecular and clinicopathological features, including age, gender, stage, KRAS mutation, BRAF mutation, microsatellite instability status and promoter DNA methylation in TCGA colon cancer dataset. This analysis revealed upregulation of XRCC5, PRKDC, and PAXX in colon cancer compared to normal colon tissues, while LIG4 and NHEJ1 (XLF) displayed downregulation. The expression of these genes was independent of age and KRAS status, while XRCC5, PRKDC, and LIG4 exhibited reduced expression in BRAF mutant tumors. Interestingly, we observed a strong association between XRCC6, XRCC5, PRKDC and LIG4 overexpression and microsatellite instability status of the tumors. In multivariate analysis, high PAXX expression emerged as an independent prognostic marker for poor overall and disease specific survival. We also observed hypomethylation of PAXX promoter in tumors, which exhibited a strong correlation with its overexpression. Furthermore, PAXX overexpression was also associated with several oncogenic pathways as well as a reduction in numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.",Colon_Cancer
"Pancreatic cancer is the deadliest disease, with a five-year overall survival rate of just 11%. The pancreatic cancer patients diagnosed with early screening have a median overall survival of nearly ten years, compared with 1.5 years for those not diagnosed with early screening. Therefore, early diagnosis and early treatment of pancreatic cancer are particularly critical. However, as a rare disease, the general screening cost of pancreatic cancer is high, the accuracy of existing tumor markers is not enough, and the efficacy of treatment methods is not exact. In terms of early diagnosis, artificial intelligence technology can quickly locate high-risk groups through medical images, pathological examination, biomarkers, and other aspects, then screening pancreatic cancer lesions early. At the same time, the artificial intelligence algorithm can also be used to predict the survival time, recurrence risk, metastasis, and therapy response which could affect the prognosis. In addition, artificial intelligence is widely used in pancreatic cancer health records, estimating medical imaging parameters, developing computer-aided diagnosis systems, etc. Advances in AI applications for pancreatic cancer will require a concerted effort among clinicians, basic scientists, statisticians, and engineers. Although it has some limitations, it will play an essential role in overcoming pancreatic cancer in the foreseeable future due to its mighty computing power.",Generic

Firstly, the recent advancements in the EVCS network, recent EV adaptation trends, and charging use cases are described as a background of the research area. Secondly, cybersecurity aspects in EVCS have been presented considering infrastructure and protocol-centric vulnerabilities with possible cyber-attack scenarios. Thirdly, threats in EVCS have been validated with real-time data-centric analysis of EV charging sessions. The paper also highlights potential open research issues in EV cyber research as new knowledge for domain researchers and practitioners.",Generic
"Glycosylation changes occur widely in colon tumours, suggesting glycosylated molecules as potential biomarkers for colon cancer diagnostics. In this study, proteoglycans (PGs) expression levels and their transcriptional patterns are investigated in human colon tumours in vivo and carcinoma cells in vitro. According to RT-PCR analysis, normal and cancer colon tissues expressed a specific set of PGs (syndecan-1, perlecan, decorin, biglycan, versican, NG2/CSPG4, serglycin, lumican, CD44), while the expression of glypican-1, brevican and aggrecan was almost undetectable. Overall transcriptional activity of the PGs in normal and cancer tissues was similar, although expression patterns were different. Expression of decorin and perlecan was down-regulated 2-fold in colon tumours, while biglycan and versican expression was significantly up-regulated (6-fold and 3-fold, respectively). Expression of collagen1A1 was also increased 6-fold in colon tumours. However, conventional HCT-116 colon carcinoma and AG2 colon cancer-initiating cells did not express biglycan and decorin and were versican-positive and -negative, respectively, demonstrating an extracellular origin of the PGs in cancer tissue. Selective expression of heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans syndecan-1 and perlecan in the AG2 colon cancer-initiating cell line suggests these PGs as potential biomarkers for cancer stem cells. Overall transcriptional activity of the HS biosynthetic system was similar in normal and cancer tissues, although significant up-regulation of extracellular sulfatases SULF1/2 argues for a possible distortion of HS sulfation patterns in colon tumours. Taken together, the obtained results suggest versican, biglycan, collagen1A1 and SULF1/2 expression as potential microenvironmental biomarkers and/or targets for colon cancer diagnostics and treatment.",Colon_Cancer
"Many disciplines, including the broad Field of Information (iField), have been offering Data Science (DS) programs. There have been significant efforts exploring an individual discipline's identity and unique contributions to the broader DS education landscape. To advance DS education in the iField, the iSchool Data Science Curriculum Committee (iDSCC) was formed and charged with building and recommending a DS education framework for iSchools. This paper reports on the research process and findings of a series of studies to address important questions: What is the iField identity in the multidisciplinary DS education landscape? What is the status of DS education in iField schools? What knowledge and skills should be included in the core curriculum for iField DS education? What are the jobs available for DS graduates from the iField? What are the differences between graduate-level and undergraduate-level DS education? Answers to these questions will not only distinguish an iField approach to DS education but also define critical components of DS curriculum. The results will inform individual DS programs in the iField to develop curriculum to support undergraduate and graduate DS education in their local context.",Generic
"Inherited colorectal cancer syndromes are responsible for a small percentage of all colorectal cancers, but affected individuals are at increased risk of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal malignancies. Gene testing plays an important diagnostic role and guides continued care to the patient and family members.

Colorectal cancer is preventable through recognition, treatment, and proper screening of those at risk.",Colon_Cancer
"Medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is an effective evidence-based therapy for decreasing opioid-related adverse outcomes. Effective strategies for retaining persons on MOUD, an essential step to improving outcomes, are needed as roughly half of all persons initiating MOUD discontinue within a year. Data science may be valuable and promising for improving MOUD retention by using ""big data"" (e.g., electronic health record data, claims data mobile/sensor data, social media data) and specific machine learning techniques (e.g., predictive modeling, natural language processing, reinforcement learning) to individualize patient care. Maximizing the utility of data science to improve MOUD retention requires a three-pronged approach: (1) increasing funding for data science research for OUD, (2) integrating data from multiple sources including treatment for OUD and general medical care as well as data not specific to medical care (e.g., mobile, sensor, and social media data), and (3) applying multiple data science approaches with integrated big data to provide insights and optimize advances in the OUD and overall addiction fields.",Generic
"The morphology of the tumor and the anatomic extent of the disease are important factors influencing treatment selection and ultimately survival for patients with lung cancer. The American Joint Committee TNM system provides a method for consistent reproducible description of the primary tumor (T), the status of the regional lymph nodes (N), and the presence or absence of distant metastasis (M). The TNM subsets thus classified can be grouped into three ""stages"" of disease such that the survival expectations for patients in each stage and cell type are similar. This classification of patients with respect to estimates of their prognosis is essential for valid comparisons of treatment modalities and meaningful communication of end results information.Clinical characteristics which influence survival are reflected in the staging recommendations. The size of the lesion, the proximal margination, and the presence or absence of other pulmonary complications are features which distinguish the T classification as T1, T2, or T3. The presence or absence of lymph node involvement has an important bearing on survival expectations. Advancing from no nodal involvement, N0, to involvement of the peribronchial and hilar nodes, N1, and then to the mediastinal nodes, N2, causes progressive erosion in survival expectations. The tumor morphology and specific nodes that are involved are important components of this relationship. The presence of distant metastasis, M1, is synonymous with an extremely poor prognosis. Using these prognostic elements, the TNM subsets are combined into three stages of disease so that patients in each group will have a generally similar life expectancy, the survival for patients with stage I disease being significantly greater than that for patients with stage II disease which is significantly greater than survival for patients with stage III disease.Improvements in the outcome for lung cancer patients depend upon the depth and scope of our scientific understandings and our ability to communicate our observations to one another. Measures of response to treatment can be translated into therapeutic practice only if uniform evaluators are used. Accordingly, a reproducible valid system for staging of lung cancer is recommended.",Lung_Cancer
"The association between physical job activity and colon cancer was examined in a 19-year follow-up study of 1.1 million Swedish men. The relative risk (RR) of colon cancer in men employed in sedentary occupations was estimated at 1.3 (1.2-1.5, 90% confidence interval), with the highest risk for the transverse colon including flexures (RR = 1.6) and the lowest risk for the sigmoid (RR = 1.2). The relative risk for rectal cancer was not elevated. Age, population density, and social class did not confound the relative risk and were controlled for, whereas marital status and geographic region did not. Furthermore, food habits and physical activity during leisure time were examined in the same occupations in another sample and it was judged unlikely that confounding from these factors could explain the association.",Colon_Cancer

"Ultrasound is the first-line diagnostic tool for diagnosis of thyroid diseases. The low aggressiveness of many thyroid cancers coupled with high sensitivity of sonography can lead to cancer diagnosis and treatment with no effect on outcomes. Ultrasound is recognized as the most important driver of thyroid cancer overdiagnosis. Ultrasound should not be used as a general screening tool and should be reserved for patients at high risk of thyroid cancer and in the diagnostic management of incidentally discovered thyroid nodules. With prescreening risk stratification and application of consensus criteria for nodule biopsy, the value of the diagnostic ultrasound can be maximized.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated a mortality reduction benefit associated with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening for lung cancer. There has been considerable debate regarding the benefits and harms of LDCT lung cancer screening, including the challenges related to its practical implementation. One of the controversies regards overdiagnosis, which conceptually denotes diagnosing a cancer that, either because of its indolent, low-aggressiveness biologic behavior or because of limited life expectancy, is unlikely to result in significant morbidity during the patient's remainder lifetime. In theory, diagnosing and treating these cancers offer no measurable benefit while incurring costs and risks. Therefore, if a screening test detects a substantial number of overdiagnosed cancers, it is less likely to be effective. It has been argued that LDCT screening for lung cancer results in an unacceptably high rate of overdiagnosis. This article aims to defend the opposite stance. Overdiagnosis does exist and to a certain extent is inherent to any cancer-screening test. Nonetheless, the concept is less dualistic and more nuanced than it has been suggested. Furthermore, the average estimates of overdiagnosis in LDCT lung cancer screening based on the totality of published data are likely much lower than the highest published estimates, if a careful definition of a positive screening test reflecting our current understanding of lung cancer biology is utilized. This article presents evidence on why reports of overdiagnosis in lung cancer screening have been exaggerated.",Lung_Cancer
"The place of external irradiation for thyroid cancers remains controversial. Between 1974 and 1989, 94 patients with a differentiated thyroid cancer were seen in our department for additional treatment (radioiodine with or without external radiation) after a surgical resection. 56 patients were treated with radioiodine alone and 38 patients had an additional course of external radiation. Survival was identical for the two groups but the local relapse rates were 21% and 3% respectively. So, in this retrospective study, the addition of external radiation appears to improve the local control especially in the case of an incomplete surgical resection or extracapsular tumor extension. This benefit was achieved without severe radiation-induced late effects.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Colorectal cancer is a major public health problem worldwide with increasing morbidity and mortality. Numerous exogenous and endogenous factors are involved in colorectal carcinogenesis: age, sex, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, exposure to harmful environmental factors, intestinal microbiota, bacterial and viral infections, the ability of the host immune system to respond, genetic factors, etc. The present study analyzed histopathologically and immunohistochemically a number of 36 cases of colorectal adenocarcinomas. The existence of an accentuated cell pleomorphism was noted, which corresponds to different clones of tumor cells, in the same tumor coexisting aspects of tubular adenocarcinoma, mucinous areas and even signet-ring cell.

"Accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations transforms normal colonic epithelial cells to adenocarcinoma cells. Genetic alterations include mutations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, whereas epigenetic mechanisms are defined as heritable alterations in gene expression that is independent of changes in the primary DNA sequence. Role of epigenetic mechanisms in development and maintenance of organ- and tissue-specific gene expression is now realized. Disturbances in epigenetic landscape can lead to malignant cellular makeover, and these heritable changes are maintained through various cycles of cell division that renders cells to have discrete identity with similar genetic information. Epigenetic alterations in colorectal cancer (CRC) that transform colonic epithelial cells into adenocarcinoma cells include aberrant DNA methylation, chromatin modifications, and noncoding RNAs, especially microRNA expression. CpG island DNA methylation and aberrant methylation of genes drive the initiation and progression of CRC. Histone modifications impinge on chromatin structure and gene expression and thus play an important role in gene silencing in CRC. DNA hypermethylation also leads to downregulation and inappropriate expression of certain microRNAs that act like tumor suppressor genes. Determining the causes and roles of epigenetic instability in CRC pathogenesis will lead to effective prevention and therapeutic strategies for patients with CRC. Epigenetic drugs that underscore the reversible nature of epigenetic events have led the possibility of epigenetic therapy as a treatment option in CRC.",Colon_Cancer

"Despite major developments in lung cancer investigations and the progress of innovative oncology treatments in recent decades, lung cancer continues to be the predominant cause of cancer-related mortality globally, with over a million deaths each year. This highlights the urgent need to develop a deeper understanding of the current state of cancer care. At the environmental and cellular levels, circadian rhythms are closely associated with living organisms. In humans, the suprachiasmatic nucleus is the principal circadian pacemaker. Circadian gene feedback loops regulate the clock, connecting peripheral tissue metabolism, cell proliferation, DNA repair, and cell death to energy homeostasis, physical activity, and neurohormonal regulation at the organismal level. Endogenous circadian homeostasis has been frequently disturbed in modern civilizations, resulting in a higher risk of many disorders, including lung cancer.

Furthermore, circadian disturbance has recently been identified as a self-regulating cancer risk factor and is listed as a carcinogen. The theory that both somatic and systemic disturbances of circadian rhythms are related to a higher risk of lung cancer development and poor prognosis is addressed in this study. The chronotherapy principles hold much more promise for enhancing the lung cancer care options currently available. Developing a better understanding of the molecular interactions that control the physiological equilibrium between both the circadian rhythm and the cycle of cell division could significantly influence the development of novel treatments for lung cancer and other diseases.",Lung_Cancer

In a case-control study of cancer of the colon it was found that 96 out of 332 (29%) cases had a positive family history of cancer of the colon (2 cases and more) as compared with 19 out of 473 (4%) controls. 3 colon cancer cases reported that 6 of their respective relatives were also affected with the same cancer. We were able to do a complete follow-up study of one family where 7 out of 12 sibling (P < 0.05) had confirmed pathological diagnoses of cancer of the colon. The mean age at diagnosis among these familial colon cancer cases was 64 years (60 years for females and 73 years for males) and all tumours were located in the caecum or right colon (a common characteristic of colon cancer in this family). There was no history of familial adenomatous polyposis in this family. It is unlikely that the significantly high proportion of familial colon cancer found could be due to chance.

"Huge advances have been made in the treatment of colon cancer over the last decade. Success has been most noticeable in stage IV disease - where careful selection of patients with small-volume disease for treatment with surgical resection perioperative chemotherapy has resulted in an improvement in survival of approximately 5-50%; and stage III - disease where the advent of 5-fluorouracil/oxaliplatin, as adjuvant treatment has also resulted in a significant prolongation in survival. Progression-free survival is now an established surrogate for overall survival, and has resulted in more timely reporting of adjuvant studies and therefore faster integration of promising agents into the clinic. Targeted agents, which have shown promise in the metastatic setting, are currently being examined in the adjuvant setting, although results so far are disappointing. Patients with high-risk stage II cancer remain a challenging group. They have a poorer prognosis than those with stage IIIA disease, and national and international guidance recommend offering chemotherapy after careful discussion of the pros and cons.

"We have developed a blood test to detect the presence of thyroactive tissues in patients being evaluated for ablative therapy of differentiated thyroid carcinomas. This test is based on the assumptions that if any thyroactive tissue is present, some radioactive T4 will be manufactured after administration of radioiodide, and that some of it will be released into the circulation. Twenty serum samples obtained from 19 patients at the time of total body 131I scanning to evaluate for the need of further 131I therapy were analyzed chromatographically, together with an internal 125I T4 marker, for the presence of 131I-labeled T4. Three patients also were studied 7 days after a treatment dose of 131I, when they returned for posttreatment scan. The chromatographic method used (Sep-Pak followed by HPLC) removes all radioiodide from the T4 fraction, so the results were interpreted as negative or positive based upon the absence or presence of detectable counts in the T4 fraction. Twelve patients (16 studies) with positive total body 131I scans all demonstrated circulating 131I T4. Seven patients with negative whole body scans were all negative for 131I T4. On the other hand, 2 patients with positive thyroglobulin assays had negative total body scans and 131I T4 tests. Both of them had independent evidence of the presence of thyroid cancer that did not concentrate radioiodine. Three patients had positive scans and 131I T4 tests but negative thyroglobulin assays. We conclude that measurement of circulating radioactive T4 is a sensitive test for the presence of normal or malignant thyroactive tissues which are likely to respond to 131I ablation.",Thyroid_Cancer

"As lung cancer has the highest cancer-specific mortality rates worldwide, there is an urgent need for new therapeutic and diagnostic approaches to detect early-stage tumors and to monitor their response to the therapy. In addition to the well-established tissue biopsy analysis, liquid-biopsy-based assays may evolve as an important diagnostic tool. The analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is the most established method, followed by other methods such as the analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and extracellular vesicles (EVs). Both PCR- and NGS-based assays are used for the mutational assessment of lung cancer, including the most frequent driver mutations. However, ctDNA analysis might also play a role in monitoring the efficacy of immunotherapy and its recent accomplishments in the landscape of state-of-the-art lung cancer therapy. Despite the promising aspects of liquid-biopsy-based assays, there are some limitations regarding their sensitivity (risk of false-negative results) and specificity (interpretation of false-positive results).

"Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, but no good clinical markers that can be used to diagnose the disease at an early stage and predict its prognosis have been found. Therefore, the discovery of novel clinical markers is required. In this study, metabolomic analysis of lung cancer patients was performed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Serum samples from 29 healthy volunteers and 33 lung cancer patients with adenocarcinoma (n=12), squamous cell carcinoma (n=11), or small cell carcinoma (n=10) ranging from stage I to stage IV disease and lung tissue samples from 7 lung cancer patients including the tumor tissue and its surrounding normal tissue were used. A total of 58 metabolites (57 individual metabolites) were detected in serum, and 71 metabolites were detected in the lung tissue. The levels of 23 of the 58 serum metabolites were significantly changed in all lung cancer patients compared with healthy volunteers, and the levels of 48 of the 71 metabolites were significantly changed in the tumor tissue compared with the non-tumor tissue. Partial least squares discriminant analysis, which is a form of multiple classification analysis, was performed using the serum sample data, and metabolites that had characteristic alterations in each histological subtype and disease stage were determined. Our results demonstrate that changes in metabolite pattern are useful for assessing the clinical characteristics of lung cancer. Our results will hopefully lead to the establishment of novel diagnostic tools.",Lung_Cancer

"Adjuvant therapy, believed by some to be of no benefit for colorectal cancer as recently as 10 years ago, now offers thousands of patients considerable hope after surgical resection. The first effective adjuvant regimen--combined fluorouracil (5-FU) and levamisole--described in 1989, was soon supplanted by a variety of 5-FU-based regimens, usually combined with leucovorin. Although most recent research in the adjuvant setting has focused on refining chemotherapy doses, schedules, and combinations, with the aim of improving efficacy and decreasing toxicity, investigators have also explored other approaches, such as portal vein infusion, monoclonal antibodies, interferon-alpha, and vaccines. Future directions being evaluated for adjuvant therapy of colon cancer include the use of oral fluorinated pyrimidines, which may replace current intravenous treatments, as well as the incorporation of new agents, such as oxaliplatin and CPT-11, into adjuvant chemotherapy programs.",Colon_Cancer
"Lung cancer incidence in Washington County, Maryland, was determined for a 12-yr period and was correlated with personal and housing data from a nonofficial 1963 census. Because indoor radon measurements were not available, two housing characteristics reported to be related to indoor radon concentration--type of basement construction and type of building materials--were used as surrogate measures. An adjusted rate of lung cancer incidence was obtained for each characteristic. Only age, male sex, amount smoked, and standard of living were significantly associated with lung cancer. Rates were highest in houses which had concrete walls and no basements, although the differences were slight and could have occurred by chance.",Lung_Cancer
"This paper attempts to review current opinions on medullary thyroid carcinoma. Histologically described for the first time in 1951 belongs to the endocrine-secreting group of tumours (APUD). It can be sporadic as well as hereditary. The histological classification nowadays is increasingly performed immunohistologically via calcitonin. Clinically the tumour ranges from the very small, but hormonally highly active form, to the aggressive, mostly undifferentiated form. According to this the therapy must be radical. Our study group recommends thyroidectomy and functional neck dissection, followed by radio-chemotherapy. A close interdisciplinary follow up of the patients is necessary. Our surgical department treated 1048 thyroid malignancies between 1949 and 1982. 26 patients (2.4%) were diagnosed to have medullary thyroid carcinoma. Follow up time was between 1 month and 17 years. The recurrence--free interval was 4.5 years. The 5 and 10 year survival rate was 52% and 26%, respectively.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Scientific findings over the past few decades have shaped our understanding of the underlying neurobiology associated with psychiatric illnesses. However, despite significant advances in research, there is widespread disappointment with the overall pace of progress in detecting and treating psychiatric disorders. Current approaches for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders largely rely on physician-patient questionnaires that are most of the time inaccurate and ineffective in providing a reliable assessment of symptoms. These limitations can, however, be overcome by applying artificial intelligence (AI) to electronic medical database and health records. AI in psychiatry is a general term that implies the use of computerized techniques and algorithms for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of mental illnesses. Although the past few years have witnessed an increase in the use of AI in the medical practice, its role in psychiatry remains a complex and unanswered question. This chapter provides the current state of knowledge of AI's use in the diagnosis, prediction, and treatment of psychiatric disorders, and examines the challenges and limitations of this approach in the medical practise.",Generic

"Thyroid cancer is a relatively rare cancer (5 new cases/y/10(5) inhabitants). An excess of thyroid carcinoma has been found in some but not in all goiter endemic areas. Follicular and anaplastic carcinomas have been found particularly frequent in regions of goitre endemia. A significant increase of thyroid carcinoma has also been found in iodine sufficient areas (Norway, Iceland, Hawaii). In several surveys a positive correlation has been found between parity and incidence of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Natural goitrogens and chemotherapeutic agents have been proved to induce hyperplasia but their role in carcinogenesis of exposed populations is not yet definitely ascertained. Exposure to external radiation is carcinogenic for the thyroid both in human and in experimental animals. Patients treated for hyperthyroidism or thyroid cancer or given diagnostic doses of 131-I (0.5 Gy/test) indicate that under these conditions 131-I is not carcinogenic. Findings on population exposed to radioactive fallout showed an increased incidence of thyroid carcinomas compared to unexposed populations. After the Chernobyl accident (1986) particular attention was given to calculate the risk of thyroid cancer caused by the fallout of 131-I. Up to now a considerable increase of thyroid carcinoma has been reported in children of a region near Chernobyl (Belarus).",Thyroid_Cancer

"Over the past 20 years, the explosion of genomic data collection and the cloud computing revolution have made computational and data science research accessible to anyone with a web browser and an internet connection. However, students at institutions with limited resources have received relatively little exposure to curricula or professional development opportunities that lead to careers in genomic data science. To broaden participation in genomics research, the scientific community needs to support these programs in local education and research at underserved institutions (UIs). These include community colleges, historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and tribal colleges and universities that support ethnically, racially, and socioeconomically underrepresented students in the United States. We have formed the Genomic Data Science Community Network to support students, faculty, and their networks to identify opportunities and broaden access to genomic data science. These opportunities include expanding access to infrastructure and data, providing UI faculty development opportunities, strengthening collaborations among faculty, recognizing UI teaching and research excellence, fostering student awareness, developing modular and open-source resources, expanding course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs), building curriculum, supporting student professional development and research, and removing financial barriers through funding programs and collaborator support.",Generic

Inflammatory bowel disease is an important risk factor for the development of colon cancer. Inflammation is also likely to be involved with other forms of sporadic as well as heritable colon cancer. The molecular mechanisms by which inflammation promotes cancer development are still being uncovered and could differ between colitis-associated and other forms of colorectal cancer. Recent work has elucidated the role of distinct immune cells, cytokines, and other immune mediators in virtually all steps of colon tumorigenesis, including initiation, promotion, progression, and metastasis.

"The emergence of serine-threonine small molecule, multi-targeted kinase inhibitors over the past decade is greatly impacting the therapeutic armamentarium for numerous malignancies, especially thyroid carcinoma. Chief among them are a class of agents referred to as vascular endothelial growth factor signal pathway inhibitors. Sorafenib is a lead compound that has been recently approved by the US FDA for radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Sorafenib clearly is altering the natural history of DTC. In the largest randomized Phase III study ever conducted in DTC, sorafenib significantly improved progression-free survival compared to placebo (10.8 vs 5.8 months) and had an acceptable and manageable safety profile, though commonly attributed side effects of hand-foot skin reaction, diarrhea and hypertension were more frequent than in other settings. This agent represents a new treatment option for patients with progressive radioactive iodine-refractory DTC.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality. After a series of clinical trials, the adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy has established a definitive role in the management of stage III colon cancer. While the precise role for chemotherapy in stage II disease remains under investigation, less toxic treatment modalities such as active specific immunotherapy (ASI) have emerged as potentially attractive alternatives. In a randomized trial it was demonstrated that ASI, using autologous tumor cells and BCG, had a significant clinical benefit in the adjuvant treatment of stage II colon cancer. In addition, it was found that the delayed-type cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions (DTH) against autologous cells correlated significantly with survival, confirming its suitability for immunomonitoring. Nowadays, 5-FU-based chemotherapy is a standard treatment for stage III colon cancer and because there is preclinical evidence for synergism between chemotherapy and ASI, we performed a phase II study to investigate whether the combined treatment with 5-FU and ASI is tolerable and feasible. We demonstrated that 5-FU treatment hardly affected the DTH response against autologous tumor cells and that the combination treatment was well tolerated. A randomized phase III trial is now warranted to show that the combination of ASI and chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone.",Colon_Cancer
"In a series of 282 resected lung specimens of primary lung cancer and 28 of metastatic lung cancer, an investigation was made on some factors influencing on the metastasis. These factors were blood vessel invasion of tumor cells, lymphoid cell infiltration at the site of vessel invasion and the basement membrane formation around the tumor foci. The relationships between the cumulative survivals and these various factors were realized with the following results. Findings of blood vessel invasion were equally correlated with the prognosis of patients as lymph node metastasis. Among patients with blood vessel invasion, those with prominent lymphoid cell reaction at the site of vessel invasion showed the longer survival than those of negative reaction. The formation of basement membrane, which was thought to be a factor influencing on the prognosis, around tumor cells, were correlated with the blood vessel invasion.",Lung_Cancer
"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death and standard chemotherapies are resulting in only marginal improvements in outcome. Experimental approaches involving gene therapy are attractive in this clinical setting. There are two basic types of genes utilized, either those intended to induce immunity or those that are directly tumoricidal. Immunity-inducing genes that have been used in model (and some human) systems include MHC molecules, costimulatory molecules, and cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, GM-CSF. These are intended to induce effective systemic immune responses against tumor antigens which would not otherwise develop. Direct toxic approaches include the reintroduction of tumor suppressor genes or enzymes which convert non-toxic drugs to toxic ones, such as herpes thymidine kinase. As a means for gene delivery, retroviruses are the most common vehicle, although Adenovirus vectors and direct DNA delivery have specific advantages.",Lung_Cancer
"Literature has recently highlighted the enormous scientific interest on the relationship between the gut microbiota and colon cancer, and how the use of some selected probiotics can have a future impact on the adverse events which occur during this disease. Although there is no clear evidence to claim that probiotics are effective in people with cancer, recent reviews have found that probiotics can significantly reduce the incidence of diarrhea and the average frequency of daily bowel movements. However, most of this evidence needs to be more clinically convincing and further discussed. Undoubtedly, some probiotics, when properly dosed and administered, can have a strong rebalance effect on the gut microbiota and as a consequence a possible positive action on immune modulation of the gastrointestinal tract and on inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. Many recent findings indeed support the hypothesis that the daily use of some selected probiotics can be a feasible approach to effectively protect patients against the risk of some severe consequences due to radiation therapy or chemotherapy. This paper aims to review the most recent articles in order to consider a possible adjuvant approach for the use of certain well-balanced probiotics to help prevent colon cancer and the adverse effects caused by related therapies.",Colon_Cancer

"After the Chernobyl accident in 1986, the ""liquidators"" or clean-up workers were among those who received the highest radiation doses to the thyroid from external radiation. Some were also exposed to radioiodines through inhalation or ingestion. A collaborative case-control study nested within cohorts of Belarusian, Russian and Baltic liquidators was conducted to evaluate the radiation-induced risk of thyroid cancer. The study included 107 cases and 423 controls. Individual doses to the thyroid from external radiation and from iodine-131 ((131)I) were estimated for each subject. Most subjects received low doses (median 69 mGy). A statistically significant dose-response relationship was found with total thyroid dose. The Excess Relative Risk (ERR) per 100 mGy was 0.38 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.10, 1.09]. The risk estimates were similar when doses from (131)I and external radiation were considered separately, although for external radiation the ERR was not statistically significantly elevated. The ERR was similar for micro carcinomas and larger size tumors, and for tumors with and without lymph node involvement. Although recall bias and uncertainties in doses could have affected the magnitude of the risk estimates, the findings of this study contribute to a better characterization the risk of thyroid cancer after radiation exposure in adulthood.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Although surgery offers the best chance of cure for patients with early stage (I-resectable III A) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the overall 5-year survival rate is modest, and systematic improvements are needed. In the 1990s, two small prospective randomized phase III trials demonstrated striking results with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and therefore several randomized trials were performed. However, there was no statistical significant trial among them. The recent systematic meta-analysis based on 8 trials revealed hazard ratio was 0.88 (95%CI: 0.76-1.01), although these data suggested a 12% relative benefit with the neoadjuvant chemotherapy, equivalent to an absolute improvement in survival of 5% at 5 years. For patients with stage N2-III A NSCLC, US intergroup trial (INT0139) also demonstrated there was no statistical difference between chemoradiotherapy following surgery and chemoradiotherapy on overall survival. At present, there is no scientific evidence of the neoadjuvant strategy for early stage NSCLC in practice.

"Diet is a major determinant of colon cancer risk. Calcium may protect against colon cancer, presumably by binding cytotoxic bile acids and fatty acids. Numerous studies support this proposition. In subjects at risk for colon cancer oral calcium supplementation has been shown to reduce rectal epithelial proliferation rate, thereby supposedly decreasing cancer risk. In contrast to the original hypothesis that phosphate counteracts the effect of calcium, evidence has now been provided that phosphate is crucial for the intraluminal binding of bile acids in complexes of calcium, phosphate, and bile acids. Supplemental calcium has been shown to reduce the cytotoxic potential of fecal water, which is probably attributable to the profound effect of calcium on bile acid and fatty acid metabolism. However, some reservation with regard to the protective ability of calcium seems to be warranted as we found that oral calcium supplementation caused an increase in epithelial proliferation rate in the sigmoid of patients with adenomatous polyps. Further controlled studies evaluating the effects of calcium on the epithelium of different parts of the colon should now be performed.",Colon_Cancer

"A review of clinical and laboratory features of thyroid cancer, designed to help in a more precise selection of patients for operation, showed that factors contributing to a high index of suspicion of cancer include previous exposure to low doses of radiation, the presence of a firm, solitary thyroid nodule clearly different from the rest of the gland, a young patient, nodules that are ""cold"" on scan with radioiodine, and nodules that fail to regress after an adequate trial of thyroxine therapy. Factors contributing to a low index of suspicion of thyroid cancer include soft or cystic lesions, multinodular goiters, nodules that are ""hot"" on (131) I scan, and those that regress during thyroxine treatment. When these factors are used to select patients for surgical operation, about 30 percent are found to have thyroid cancer. Until more precise methods for preoperative diagnosis are established, it is suggested that this type of clinical selection may be very helpful in the management of patients with thyroid nodules or nontoxic goiter.",Thyroid_Cancer
"In small cell lung cancer, combination chemotherapy including agents such etoposide, teniposide, cisplatin, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, vincristine and cyclophosphamide continues to be the cornerstone of therapy. The importance of dose scheduling of etoposide with continuous treatment of 5 days' duration or more is becoming more and more clear. Complete or partial responses secondary to combination chemotherapy occur in 80-90% of all patients with median durations of 9 to 11 months. Median survival in these studies is unchanged, at present 11-16 months depending on the initial tumour stage. The optimum duration of treatment is still uncertain, but generally a period of 6 to 9 months is used. The use of G-CSF with combination chemotherapy leads to reductions in the incidence of fever, duration and severity of grade 4 neutropenia, and in the total number of days of treatment with i.v. antibiotics and days of hospitalization. No differences have been observed in response rates, duration of response or survival. Therapeutic results for epidermoid, cancer, adeno carcinoma, large cell carcinoma and mesothelioma are essentially unchanged. The treatment of patients with these tumours should continue to be considered experimental since no standard chemotherapy has as yet been developed, neither when given as single modality nor in combination with surgery or radiotherapy. Two studies published in 1991 comparing induction chemotherapy before irradiation versus irradiation alone have resulted in improvement of median and 2-year survival, while a third study did not show such an improvement. The fact remains that three-fourths of patients with local disease die within 3 years, and further improvements in both systemic and local treatment are needed.",Lung_Cancer

"Oncogene activation by gene amplification is a major pathogenetic mechanism in human cancer. Using comparative genomic hybridization, we determined that metastatic human colon cancers commonly acquire numerous extra copies of chromosome arms 7p, 8q, 13q, and 20q. We then examined the consequence of these amplifications on gene expression using DNA microarrays. Of 55,000 transcripts profiled, 2,146 were determined to map to one of the four common colon cancer amplicons and to also be expressed in normal or malignant colon tissues. Of these, only 81 transcripts (3.8%) demonstrated a 2-fold increase over normal expression among cancers bearing the corresponding chromosomal amplification.

"Human colon cancer affects nearly 150,000 patients and results in 60,000 deaths in the United States per year. Despite significant advances in the management of the colon cancer patient, little change in survival rates has been appreciated over the past 50 years. The primary cause of death relates to the development of distant metastases to organs such as the liver and lungs. Colon cancer represents an important disease to study in order to better understand tumor progression and metastasis primarily because there is almost a stepwise advancement of the disease that is marked by measurable genetic and associated phenotypic alterations. Metastasis appears to be the end product of the development of 'Herculean' cell clones capable of independent growth, invasion, adhesion, avoidance of apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the sequential genetic events leading to the development of cancer, the precise genes and the associated molecular pathways underlying the development of metastatic potential are still poorly understood. Moreover, our enhanced genetic knowledge has had relatively little trickle down effect on our clinical management of this deadly disease. For this reason, we undertook a comprehensive study to develop a molecular encyclopedia of new tumor markers and markers of tumor progression, some of which will hopefully prove useful in the clinical management of colon cancer patients by means of their capacity to detect and predict the stage and disease burden. This review will focus on the application of gene expression profiling technology to the problem of identifying new tumor markers and progression markers, and the discovery of osteopontin as the leading candidate clinical marker derived from a screen of approximately 12,000 named genes.",Colon_Cancer

"The significance of mucinous carcinoma has been controversial since first described by Parham in 1923. Previous reports have suggested that mucinous tumors affect young patients, involve the more proximal colon, are more advanced at diagnosis, and have a poorer prognosis than nonmucinous colon carcinoma. More recent reports have refuted these results. In an effort to clarify the significance of mucinous histology, a retrospective review of cases of invasive colon cancer treated at the Ochsner Clinic between 1982 and 1985 was undertaken. Mucinous adenocarcinoma, as defined by > or = 50 percent mucin, was found in 52 patients. During the same period, 343 nonmucinous adenocarcinomas were resected. The mean age, distribution within the colon, stage at diagnosis, and survival of mucinous carcinoma patients were compared with those with nonmucinous tumors. Mucinous tumors presented at a statistically significant more advanced stage (38 percent vs. 22 percent Dukes C lesions; P < 0.01). No significant differences were seen in age at presentation, distribution within the colon, or stage-for-stage survival when the entire group was analyzed. Mucinous carcinomas of the rectum occurred at an advanced stage more frequently (P < 0.05) than nonmucinous rectal carcinomas and had a markedly worse five-year survival (11 percent vs. 57 percent; P < 0.002).",Colon_Cancer

"Lung cancer incidence in Finland ranked first in the late fifties. In the seventies, 2,000 new cases of lung cancer in males were registered annually, i.e. more more than a third of all newly-registered cases of cancer. At present lung cancer ranks tenth in females. About 300 new cases (nearly 5% of all primary malignancies) are reported every year. Every effort must be made to comprehend the etiology of lung cancer and to develop methods of its prevention.",Lung_Cancer
"The enormous number of newly diagnosed cases of colorectal cancer that occur each year and the lack of agents that are highly effective for all patients underscore the need for novel approaches to combating the disease. Gene therapy as a developing treatment modality is already well established, with a number of trials ongoing and a vast range of other approaches being assessed in animal and cell culture experiments. In this brief review, we have discussed five gene therapy trials in colon carcinoma that are ongoing or in the approval process in the United States. The gene therapy approaches being employed can be divided into three major categories: (1) enzyme/prodrug systems (HSVtk/ganciclovir; CD/5-fluorocytosine); (2) tumor suppressor gene replacement therapy with wild-type p53; and (3) immune-gene therapy which is based on cytokine or tumor antigen expression to induce tumor immunity (e.g., CEA). Replication-deficient recombinant adenoviral vectors are predominantly used for colon cancer gene therapy, because they can be produced at high titer and they readily infect a number of different cell types. One trial uses polynucleotide therapy for antitumor immunization with intramuscular injection. All of these studies are phase I trials, principally designed to evaluate safety, but they will also provide data on gene delivery. Some trials may provide some insight into potential therapeutic effects. We have alluded to some of the concerns on toxicity related to the use of adenovirus, risks and side effects from transgenes, lack of tumor-specificity of transgene expression, and potential problems with efficient gene delivery to solid tumors. The clinical trials, however, will provide insight that will inform design of future studies with respect to dose, form, and frequency of administration, as well as to the value of biologic and clinical endpoints. The molecular analysis of the fundamental basis of colon cancer has moved at a remarkable pace and that progress seems set to continue. Thus, the basic foundations for gene therapy are undoubtedly in place: a clinical need; growing understanding of basic tumor biology; and ever-improving delivery systems. The field is at a very early stage in its evolution, and one concern is that the considerable hurdles that must be overcome are seen as examples of the failure of cancer gene therapy; however, we believe these challenges will be overcome. The authors also believe that colon cancer gene therapy is likely to take new directions, such as use as adjuvant to radical surgery, rather than attempts to treat end-stage disease when the liver is replaced by metastases. Other new directions might include prophylactic gene-based immunization against a panel of well-characterized tumor antigens, at least for persons shown to be at high risk of colon cancer because of genetic or other predisposition. A marriage between gene therapy approaches and conventional anticancer treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy also seems likely. There is already evidence of this move with demonstration of synergism between p53 replacement and radiotherapy and chemotherapy. It is also likely that therapies will be developed that combine elements from the cancer gene therapies discussed previously, namely, suicide gene transfer, immune modulation, and modulation of defective cancer genes. Perhaps one of the main concerns is not that researchers in cancer gene therapy want to walk before they can run, but that the public and government agencies believe they can. The next 10 years will be an interesting time in the development of novel treatments against colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Epidemiologic evidence on the relationship between nutrition and lung cancer is reviewed. Observational studies of diet and lung cancer, both prospective and retrospective, continue to suggest strongly that increased vegetable and fruit intake is associated with reduced risk in men and women; in various countries; in smokers, ex-smokers, and never-smokers; and for all histologic types of lung cancer. Prospective studies of blood beta-carotene levels, arguably the best available biomarker of vegetable and fruit intake, indicate that low levels are predictive of increased lung cancer incidence. However, in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in male smokers, lung cancer incidence and total mortality were increased significantly among the men receiving beta-carotene supplements. If beta-carotene can prevent lung carcinogenesis, which the trial cannot rule out, then the dosage, duration of use, method of administration, and/or subpopulation are critical. Ongoing clinical trials, some of which include women, will provide much-needed information. Other carotenoids, other phytochemicals, and associated dietary patterns may explain the beneficial effects of vegetables and fruits and have not been explored adequately in epidemiologic work. Several observational epidemiologic studies, both prospective and retrospective, have indicated that diets high in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol may increase the risk of lung cancer and that the effect is not mediated through vegetable and fruit intake. The relationship, although not yet established, merits further investigation. Since beta-carotene can function as an antioxidant, other micronutrients with this potential, specifically vitamins E and C and selenium, also have been proposed to reduce lung cancer risk. However, the totality of the epidemiologic evidence is not, at present, persuasive for any one of these micronutrients.",Lung_Cancer
"BACKGROUND: Medullary thyroid cancer, a tumor of the parafollicular C cells, accounts for approximately 10% of all thyroid malignancies. An estimated 75% of cases are sporadic, and the remaining 25% are familial. METHODS: The author reviews the clinical features and diagnostic tests for this entity, as well as the surgical treatment of recurrent or persistent medullary carcinoma. RESULTS: Sporadic medullary thyroid cancer typically presents as an isolated unilateral mass. Familial tumors tend to be multifocal and bilateral. In patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A, pheochromocytomas and parathyroid hyperplasia also may develop. Care is taken to avoid operating on a patient with occult pheochromocytoma. Total thyroidectomy and central lymph node dissection are the keys for successful surgical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is the cornerstone of treatment for medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. Genetic testing using the ret oncogene allows identification of individuals who are at risk for the disease or those with early-stage disease.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The past decade has seen steady advances in the field of radiation therapy, impacting definitive treatment options for early and advanced tumors, as well as identifying further roles for adjuvant and palliative therapy. The widespread availability of (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomographic (FDG PET) imaging has improved staging, and better defines a population that will benefit from aggressive local therapy. Technological advances in radiation treatment planning allow for less normal lung irradiation, allowing increasing dose and decreasing normal tissue toxicity. Ongoing clinical investigations in the role of radiosurgery for early lung tumors, postoperative radiation of locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and prophylactic cranial irradiation in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) help to identify patients who may benefit from treatment.",Lung_Cancer
"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most lethal of all cancers. It is more common in women and occurs primarily in older patients. ATC has a median overall survival of 3-5 months and a nearly 100% disease-specific mortality. It is known to spread rapidly to locoregional structures as well as outside the neck to distant sites, hence ATC is always considered stage IV. With better understanding of the disease at a molecular level, the introduction of newer treatment strategies has been possible and is part of the multimodal (surgery, radiation, and systemic therapy) therapeutic approach. However, there is extensive work needed to achieve better survival outcomes.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Bronchial cancer is the ideal candidate for the application of screening strategies: it is a serious, frequent disease and its diagnosis is often delayed. Moreover, only the early stages of the disease offer high hopes of being cured. However, proof of the impact of screening has not been supplied either by X-ray or by cytological examination of expectorations, despite numerous open and subsequent randomised trials. Recently, the low dose scan has shown to be a technique far more sensitive than X-ray and capable of detecting early stage tumours. Nevertheless, it is also a barely specific examination revealing a great number of benign abnormalities and perhaps leading to futile examinations. Because of this, the eventual demonstration of the impact of the scan on the lung cancer mortality warrants the development of randomised trials.",Lung_Cancer
"Colon cancer (CC) belongs to a widespread malignant progression from the digestive tract. Moreover, CC is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. It was suggested that there are several causative risk factors, among which are genetic factors that play an important role in the predisposition and development of CC. Unfortunately, despite continuous vigorous research going back more than two decades regarding molecular genetics and epigenetics on the issues of CC, there were no suitable prognostic and predictive molecular biomarkers identified until now. There are several susceptible genes for CC. Researchers are still unsure about the mechanisms regarding the genetic predisposition and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The SNPs are considered to be clinically important aspotential diagnostics and therapeutic biomarkers in the future. Thus, in this review, we revise some gene SNPs involved in inducing CC.",Colon_Cancer

"Large thyroid carcinomas extending into the anterior mediastinum were removed from six patients by a transsternal surgical approach (partial median sternotomy). Transcervical mediastinal dissection offers obscure exposure and therefore entails the risk of the operation not being radical. The transsternal procedure was used as an alternative to remove affected lymphatic and fatty tissue from an additional nine patients. Sternal metastases were extirpated from 10 patients. Irrespective of the stage of the tumor, the indications for a transsternal approach to onocologically radical extirpation of tumors and mediastinal lymphatic fatty tissue should be more liberal, particularly with differentiated and medullary thyroid carcinomas. The prognosis for differentiated carcinomas is improved by radioiodine treatment, and optimal conditions for this therapy are ensured by the most radical possible removal of the tumor with its affected lymph nodes and sternal metastases. In the case of mixed differentiated/anaplastic and medullary carcinomas, this operative procedure ensures favorable conditions for other adjuvant forms of therapy. Although it was not possible to extend the life expectancy of patients suffering from anaplastic carcinomas, their quality of life was at least improved by the prevention of mechanical dyspnea caused by the mediastinal tumor.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The human lung has a resident population of neuroendocrine (NE) cells. These are characterised by the presence of neurosecretory granules and by a number of histochemical and immunocytochemical reactions. NE differentiation is a defining feature of classical and atypical carcinoid tumours and is seen in most small cell lung cancers (SCLC). Such differentiation has also been described in up to one third of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). As demonstrated in an accompanying paper in this issue of the Journal, the reporting of NE differentiation varies with the technical approach used and with the nature of the tissue specimen. This phenomenon is a reflection of the histological and biological heterogeneity of lung cancer and has not been shown to be of clinical utility.",Lung_Cancer
"Many approaches have been developed to targeting therapy for lung cancer. The representatives types have included photodynamic therapy (PDT), bronchial arterial infusion of anticancer agent and/or embolization, intensification of the effect of drugs on tumor tissue and drug delivery systems (DDS) using liposomes. In our hospital, 195 lung cancer patients, including those with 56 early stage lesions, have been treated with PDT, and a CR rate of 65.2% was obtained. Bronchial arterial infusion (BAI) for clinical N2, in-operable non-small cell lung cancer patients has prolonged median survival time compared to the patients treated without BAI. Combined modalities of chemotherapy and low power laser (He-Ne Laser) irradiation in the experimental animal model have been shown. This combined therapy may permit enhancement of the antitumor effects of routine chemotherapy by reducing the side effects of the drug. DDS using liposomes may well be a major targeting therapy for lung cancer. In our data, trans-bronchial injection of chemotherapeutic drugs encapsulated with liposomes will be most effective for mediastinal lymph node metastasis of lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer

"Cells in a developing embryo communicate with each other through a limited number of intercellular signalling pathways, of which the Wnt signalling pathway is one. Little is known about the function of Wnt signalling beyond that in embryogenesis. However, recent insights into the molecular etiology of colon cancer have implied a central role for the Wnt signalling pathway. The malignant transformation of colorectal epithelium is well defined, leading to adenoma and sequentially carcinoma formation. Several genes that regulate the Wnt pathway are mutated in cancer of the human colon and other organs. All of these mutations lead to the inappropriate activation of the pathway, which instructs the cell to divide unrestrictedly. These insights now allow the Wnt pathway to be exploited as a new target for drug development in colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer

"Lung cancer risk among exsmokers according to years since cessation of smoking was assessed by means of a case-control study. The case series consisted of 1,052 lung cancer patients who were newly diagnosed and admitted to eight hospitals in Osaka in 1986-88. Smoking histories were compared with those of 1,111 controls admitted to the same hospitals during the same period without any diagnosis of smoking-related disease. The odds ratio of lung cancer for exsmokers compared to current smokers was estimated to be 0.90, 0.50, 0.51, 0.59, 0.48 and 0.29, for 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24 and greater than or equal to 25 years after cessation of smoking, respectively. Risk reduction appeared to be greater for those who smoked less than the 1200 cigarette index, compared to those who smoked more. In classification according to histologic type, small cell and large cell carcinoma showed a rapid decrease compared to adenocarcinoma, while squamous cell carcinoma showed an intermediate pattern. Quantitative estimates for reduction of lung cancer risk among exsmokers can be used for projecting lung cancer incidence in the future, by assuming future trends of smoking prevalence, as well as for health education among individual smokers.",Lung_Cancer

"To date, in lung cancer, early attempts to modulate the immune system via vaccine-based therapeutics have been unsuccessful. An improved understanding of tumor immunology has facilitated the production of more sophisticated lung cancer vaccines. It is anticipated that it will likely require multiple epitopes of a diverse set of genes restricted to multiple haplotypes to generate a truly effective vaccine that is able to overcome the various immunologic escape mechanisms that tumors employ. Other issues to overcome include optimal patient selection, which adjuvant agent to use, and how to adequately monitor for an immunologic response. This review discusses the most promising vaccination strategies for non-small cell lung cancer including the allogeneic tumor cell vaccine belagenpumatucel-L, which is a mixture of 4 allogeneic non-small cell lung cancer cell lines genetically modified to secrete an antisense oligonucleotide to transforming growth factor 2 and 3 other target protein-specific vaccines designed to induce responses against melanoma-associated antigen A3, mucin 1, and epidermal growth factor.",Lung_Cancer
"Systemic chemotherapies for advanced or metastatic thyroid carcinomas have been of only limited effectiveness. For patients with differentiated or medullary carcinomas unresponsive to conventional treatments, novel therapies are needed to improve disease outcomes. Multiple novel therapies primarily targeting angiogenesis have entered clinical trials for metastatic thyroid carcinoma. Partial response rates up to 30% have been reported in single agent studies, but prolonged disease stabilization is more commonly seen. The most successful agents target the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, with potential targets including the mutant kinases associated with papillary and medullary oncogenesis. Two drugs approved for other malignancies, sorafenib and sunitinib, have had promising preliminary results reported, and are being used selectively for patients who do not qualify for clinical trials. Additional agents targeting tumor vasculature, nuclear receptors, epigenetic abnormalities, and the immune response to neoplasia have also been investigated. Randomized trials for several agents are underway that may lead to eventual drug approval for thyroid cancer. Treatment for patients with metastatic or advanced thyroid carcinoma now emphasizes clinical trial opportunities for novel agents with considerable promise. Alternative options now exist for use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are well tolerated and may prove worthy of regulatory approval for this disease.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Calcium has been hypothesized as being a regulator of cell proliferation in the colon. Epidemiologic studies suggest that ingestion of higher levels of dietary calcium are related to a decreased risk for colon cancer. Short term studies in vitro and in vivo of the proliferative behavior of human and animal colon mucosa verify that calcium does modulate proliferative response. Preliminary clinical studies suggest that the hyperproliferative mucosa of patients at high risk for colon cancer, based on proliferation analysis of biopsied mucosa, became decidedly less proliferative when the subjects were given oral calcium. Our studies address the molecular mechanisms by which calcium controls mucosal proliferation and the ways in which tumor cells circumvent this regulation.",Colon_Cancer
"Differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) combined with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a rare situation, and there is no well-established causal relationship. CH is a common congenital endocrine, while DTC occurring in childhood represents 0.4-3% of all malignancies at this stage of life. The association of CH with DTC could be related to dyshormonogenetic goiter (DHG) or developmental abnormalities. This review will explore the clinical features and the molecular mechanisms potentially associated with the appearance of DTC in CH: sporadic somatic driver mutations, chronic increase of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), cell division cycle associated 8 (Borelain/CDC8) gene mutations, and in others genes associated with CH - either alone or associated with the mechanisms involved in dyshormonogenesis. There are some pitfalls in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer in patients with CH with nodular goiter, as the proper cytological diagnosis of nodules of patients with dyshormonogenesis might be demanding due to the specific architectural and cytological appearance, which may lead to an erroneous interpretation of malignancy. The purpose of this article is to suggest an analytical framework that embraces the fundamental relationships between the various aspects of CH and CDT. In face of this scenario, the entire genetic and epigenetic context, the complex functioning, and cross talk of cell signaling may determine cellular mechanisms promoting both the maintenance of the differentiated state of the thyroid follicular cell and the disruption of its homeostasis leading to cancer. Whereas, the exact mechanisms for thyroid cancer development in CH remain to be elucidated.",Thyroid_Cancer

"There is no effective treatment for patients with poorly differentiated papillary thyroid cancer or anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). Anlotinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, has already shown antitumor effects in various types of carcinoma in a phase I clinical trial. In this study, we aimed to better understand the effect and efficacy of anlotinib against thyroid carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that anlotinib inhibits the cell viability of papillary thyroid cancer and ATC cell lines, likely due to abnormal spindle assembly, G2/M arrest, and activation of TP53 upon anlotinib treatment. Moreover, anlotinib suppresses the migration of thyroid cancer cells in vitro and the growth of xenograft thyroid tumors in mice.

Data were collected using a web-based online anonymous survey under Institutional Review Board approval from Boston University. This report is based on 27 responses from subjects with thyroid cancer who use kelp. Demographic factors and complementary and alternative use were included. Respondents were primarily over age 40, white, female and have at least a high school education. The top five modalities were multivitamins, special diets, herbal supplements, prayer for health reasons and herbal tea. Only one patient reported perceiving a particular modality had a negative effect on treatment. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) was more often perceived as being used to aid their thyroid cancer treatment than to help with symptoms. On average, respondents who use kelp also use at least 11 additional CAM modalities. Only 1/2 of respondents who use kelp reported telling their physicians about their CAM use, and nearly 1/3 of respondents reported their CAM use was neither known, prescribed nor asked about by their physicians. In comparison to both national surveys of the general US population and patients with thyroid cancer, kelp users with thyroid cancer use at least twice the number of additional CAM therapies and report their use far less often.

"There are 5 main histological types of thyroid cancers (TCs): papillary, follicular (also known as differentiated), poorly differentiated, anaplastic (the most aggressive form), and medullary TC, and only the latter arises from thyroid C cells. These different forms of TCs show significant variability, both among and within tumours. This great variation is particularly notable among the first 4 types, which all originate from thyroid follicular cells. Importantly, this heterogeneity is not limited to histopathological diversity only but is also manifested as variation in several genetic and/or epigenetic alterations, the numbers of interactions between the tumour and surrounding microenvironment, and interpatient differences, for example. All these factors contribute to the great complexity in the development of a tumour from cancer cells. In the present review, we summarise the knowledge accumulated about the heterogeneity of TCs. Further research in this direction should help to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms contributing to the development and diversity of TCs, paving the way toward more effective treatment strategies.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Tobacco use in cancer patients is associated with increased cancer treatment failure and decreased survival. Nicotine is one of over 7,000 compounds in tobacco smoke and nicotine is the principal chemical associated with addiction. The purpose of this article is to review the tumor promoting activities of nicotine. Nicotine and its metabolites can promote tumor growth through increased proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and stimulation of autocrine loops associated with tumor growth. Furthermore, nicotine can decrease the biologic effectiveness of conventional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Common mechanisms appear to involve activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and beta-adrenergic receptors leading to downstream activation of parallel signal transduction pathways that facilitate tumor progression and resistance to treatment. Data suggest that nicotine may be an important mechanism by which tobacco promotes tumor development, progression, and resistance to cancer treatment.",Lung_Cancer

In a Phase III clinical study, cabozantinib improved PFS (11.2 months versus 4.0 months in the placebo group) of patients with MTC (independently of age, bone metastases, RET status and prior treatment). Cabozantinib was approved in 2012 by FDA for metastatic MTC and in 2013 by EMA. Cabozantinib has been also evaluated in metastatic DTC patients, because they have activation on tyrosine kinases, including MET, VEGFR2 and RET, suggesting the possible use of cabozantinib in metastatic DTC. Actually, two Phase II trials of cabozantinib in DTC patients resistant to RAI are ongoing. To increase the antineoplastic effect of cabozantinib, and to overcome the occurrence of drug resistance, combination studies with other anticancer agents are ongoing.

"Preanalytic sampling techniques and preparation of tissue specimens strongly influence analytical results in lung tissue diagnostics both on the morphological but also on the molecular level. However, in contrast to analytics where tremendous achievements in the last decade have led to a whole new portfolio of test methods, developments in preanalytics have been minimal. This is specifically unfortunate in lung cancer, where usually only small amounts of tissue are at hand and optimization in all processing steps is mandatory in order to increase the diagnostic yield. In the following, we provide a comprehensive overview on some aspects of preanalytics in lung cancer from the method of sampling over tissue processing to its impact on analytical test results.

Guided by the Self-regulation model, we investigated the association of demographic, cultural (e.g., fatalism, religious commitment), and psychological factors (e.g., perceived risk, general mood) with CC worry among a sample of Appalachian women. A mixed method design was utilized. Appalachian women completed surveys in the quantitative section (n = 134) and semi-structured interviews in the qualitative section (n = 24). Logistic regression was employed to calculate odds ratios (OR) for quantitative data, and immersion/crystallization was utilized to analyze qualitative data. In the quantitative section, 45% of the participants expressed some degree of CC worry. CC worry was associated with higher than high school education (OR 3.63), absolute perceived risk for CC (OR 5.82), high anxiety (OR 4.68), and awareness of easy access (OR 3.98) or difficult access (OR 3.18) to health care specialists as compared to not being aware of the access. there was no association between CC worry and adherence to CC screening guidelines. The qualitative section revealed fear, disengagement, depression, shock, and worry. Additionally, embarrassment, discomfort, and worry were reported with regard to CC screening. Fears included having to wear a colostomy bag and being a burden on family. CC worry was common in Appalachians and associated with higher perceptions of risk for CC and general anxiety, but not with adherence to screening guidelines. The mixed method design allowed for enhanced understanding of CC-related feelings, especially CC worry, including social/contextual fears.",Colon_Cancer
Lung cancer in Vojvodina is the leading form of cancer as well as the leading cause of cancer deaths in men. It ranks 2nd in cancer deaths in women in Vojvodina.

"Sessions about lung cancer of the 28th annual meeting of ASCO approached especially non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Undoubtedly the outstanding facts for this pathology was first the acknowledgment of the importance of a correct staging system, in particular in stage IIIA for which resection is a prognostic factor different for tumors T3N0, T3N1 as for N2. Two important topics have been discussed on therapy: stage IIIA treatment, in particular neoadjuvant therapy before surgery, and new drugs like Navelbine, taxol, and campthotecine which suggest the possibility of improvements for chemotherapy of NSCLC in the next few years. For small cell lung cancer (SCLC), different trials were designed to improve dose intensity with growth factors, fractionation of therapy, autologous bone marrow transplantation.",Lung_Cancer
"Molecular genetic studies of tumor-specific allele loss, originally associated primarily with research regarding childhood hereditary cancers such as retinoblastoma and Wilms' tumors, only lately have been recognized as a relatively fast and fruitful way of locating cancer genes on human chromosomes. To date, over 25 different cancers have been tied to a gene (or genes) on a specific chromosome when this method has been used. During the past year alone, this approach has permitted detection of three genes involved in either hereditary or sporadic colorectal cancers. These three genes, located on chromosomes 5q, 17p, and 18q, are believed to belong to the newly described tumor suppressor (or growth suppressor) gene class, whose effects are opposite those of activated cellular oncogenes, which promote uncontrolled cell growth. Present studies, however, have not shown losses of any of these tumor suppressor genes to be correlated with the presence of activated ras genes in colorectal adenomas or carcinomas. During progression from adenoma to carcinoma, ras gene mutations and 5q allelic deletions are likely to be earlier events, whereas allelic losses from chromosomes 18q and 17p seem to occur more often in advanced tumors. Involvement of the genes on 5q (FAP) and 18q (Lynch syndrome II) in hereditary colon cancer syndromes is supported by linkage studies, but their respective roles (as well as that of the gene on 17p) in familial and sporadic colorectal cancer remain to be precisely defined. Probable isolation of these three genes by molecular cloning within the next few years will help elucidate their specific biologic functions. It will also permit early detection, and thus prevention, of some familial colon cancers (such as FAP), and possibly allow DNA marker-based separation of different colon cancer subtypes of similar histologic appearance.",Colon_Cancer
"The most widely used diagnostic nuclear medicine technique in well-differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is radioiodine scintigraphy, either diagnostic or post-therapeutic, together with serum thyroglobulin (Tg) measurement; this combination is usually able to determine the presence or absence of cancer. FDG-PET has shown less sensitivity in DTC that retains the ability to trap 131I. Several alternative procedures with single photon emitting radiopharmaceuticals have been evaluated including whole body scan with 201Tl, 99mTc-sestamibi or tetrofosmin scan, with different sensitivity and specificity. The main advantage of these tests is that their results are not influenced by the levels of TSH, therefore they do not require a hypothyroid state in the patient. Recently positron emission tomography (PET) with FDG has been demonstrated to be highly useful in thyroid cancer patients with a negative 131I whole body scan but measurable Tg. According to reports in the literature FDG-PET in the follow-up of operated patients has a sensitivity ranging from 70% to 90% in identifying the source of Tg. The demonstration of lesions can lead to a change in treatment including surgery or external radiation instead of radioiodine treatment. In Europe, medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is currently visualized by 99mTc pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 99mTc-sestamibi or tetrofosmin. Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) radiolabeled with 123I or 131I is another reliable radiopharmaceutical for medullary tumors. (111)In-pentetreotide scan is positive in a high percentage of patients because MTC expresses somatostatin receptors. FDG-PET has an interesting role to play in calcitonin-positive patients, where PET has been shown to correctly identify lesions in cervical and mediastinal lymph nodes as well as at distant sites. Furthermore, calcitonin-guided PET has been found to be superior to CT and MRI in many patients. Recent reports indicated that 18F-DOPA scan in MTC seems to be more accurate than FDG-PET.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC ) is usually not very common ( incidence is about 1 % of all cancers and women are more often affected than men ). However, higher incidences has been reported in many parts of South East Asia particularly in iodine deficient areas. Unlike other solid tumors, DTC is potentially curable with documented survival rate of > 90 %. Even if the disease is not totally cured, through repeated high dose radio iodine therapy the progress of the disease can be controlled with significant improvement in quality of life for many years. This is possible if a proper and state of the art therapeutic approach is made. Since the incidence is relatively low, individual experience of treating physicians or centers is mostly inadequate leading to improper management with subsequent increase in morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this review is to evolve a rational management protocol for the treatment of thyroid cancer. Centers which do not have all facilities like high dose radio iodine therapy etc. may still follow the protocol by referring the patient for a particular step to another centre. What is needed is the awareness of the treating physician about the appropriate management of DTC. In recent years, there have been some important developments in the management of differentiated thyroid cancer like use of recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH), use of retinoic acid for redifferentiation etc. Some of these developments having practical relevance have been briefly mentioned.",Thyroid_Cancer
"A series of 405 patients with thyroid cancer treated by surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy from February 1958 through 1979 is reported. The immediate evaluation of the operation was that it was either incomplete or complete. Incomplete surgery implied that there was (1) possible residual tumor in the operative field, the result of difficult dissection of the tumor off the neighboring organs or tissues, as assessed by the surgeon; (2) multiple (more than five) lymph nodes involved; (3) positive border of the removed lesions; or (4) microscopic evidence of tumor in the operative field. Complete surgery implied through extirpation of cancer grossly and microscopically. In 297 patients who had complete surgery, 238 patients treated by surgery alone had a 5-year survival rate of 92% (218/238), while 59 patients who received postoperative radiotherapy had a 5-year survival rate of 78% (46/59). The optimum dose of postoperative radiotherapy was 50-70 Gy in 5 to 8 weeks, with the spinal dose kept under 40 Gy. Our experience shows that postoperative radiotherapy did not improve the survival of patients who had had complete surgery. Yet, in 108 patients who had incomplete surgery, surgery alone yielded a 5-year survival rate of 33% (19/57), while surgery plus radiotherapy yielded a 5-year survival of 71% (36/51). Our observation shows a remarkable benefit with postoperative radiotherapy in patients who have had incomplete surgery (P less than 0.05). According to pathologic criteria, postoperative radiotherapy was more effective in well-differentiated cancers than in poorly differentiated ones. It was equally effective in untreated as well as recurrent lesions. The prognosis for younger patients was better, but the sex of the patients did not affect prognosis.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Although thyroid cancer generally has a good prognosis, there is a subset of patients for whom standard care (ie, treatment limited to surgery or surgery plus radioactive iodine) is either not appropriate because of the aggressive nature of their disease or not sufficient because of disease progression through standard treatment. Most of these tumors are in 3 groups: radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma including poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, and progressive medullary thyroid carcinoma. Major classes of treatments in clinical development for these aggressive thyroid tumors include tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Lung cancer is the leading cause of death of cancer in Australian men and the third leading cause in Australian women. Efforts are being made to reduce the incidence of this disease by smoking-cessation programmes and improved industrial hygiene, and these measures need to be encouraged strongly by all sectors of the community. On a population basis, insufficient evidence is available to justify screening procedures for the early detection of lung cancer in ""at-risk"" groups. Cure is possible by surgical resection in early cases. Improvements in therapeutic results with traditional cancer treatments largely have reached a plateau, but a number of newer therapies, and combinations of standard therapies, currently are being evaluated. Of particular interest is concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy in localized non-small-cell lung cancer; laser ""debulking"" in conjunction with radiotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer, and biological response-modifying agents in non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer. It is important that data be collected adequately to define epidemiological changes and to evaluate treatment results (including repeat bronchoscopy, to assess local control of tumour), and that the quality of life is recorded and reported in the evaluation process. Finally, phase-III studies in lung-cancer treatments require adequate numbers of subjects to enable meaningful conclusions to be achieve objectives within a reasonable study period.",Lung_Cancer
"Poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) have a worse prognosis with respect to well differentiated TC, and the loss of the capability of up-taking 131I is one of the main features characterizing aggressive TC. The knowledge of the genomic landscape of TC can help clinicians to discover the responsible alterations underlying more advance diseases and to address more tailored therapy. In fact, to date, the antiangiogenic multi-targeted kinase inhibitor (aaMKIs) sorafenib, lenvatinib, and cabozantinib, have been approved for the therapy of aggressive radioiodine (RAI)-resistant papillary TC (PTC) or follicular TC (FTC). Several other compounds, including immunotherapies, have been introduced and, in part, approved for the treatment of TC harboring specific mutations. For example, selpercatinib and pralsetinib inhibit mutant RET in medullary thyroid cancer but they can also block the RET fusion proteins-mediated signaling found in PTC. Entrectinib and larotrectinib, can be used in patients with progressive RAI-resistant TC harboring TRK fusion proteins. In addition FDA authorized the association of dabrafenib (BRAFV600E inhibitor) and trametinib (MEK inhibitor) for the treatment of BRAFV600E-mutated ATC. These drugs not only can limit the cancer spread, but in some circumstance they are able to induce the re-differentiation of aggressive tumors, which can be again submitted to new attempts of RAI therapy. In this review we explore the current knowledge on the genetic landscape of TC and its implication on the development of new precise therapeutic strategies.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The human evidence that dietary fiber prevents the development of colon cancer has been reviewed. The correlational studies are consistent with a protective effect in 61.9 per cent of reports. However, these studies are all retrospective and largely uncontrolled. The case-control studies provide evidence of a protective effect in only 48 per cent of reports. It is of additional concern that some human studies have found an association between tumor enhancement and some fiber-containing foods. Whereas this is not sufficient evidence to implicate dietary fiber as a promoter of human colon cancer, it does perhaps argue for a more conservative approach to recommending high-fiber diets as a means of cancer prevention. The animal data show that different sources of dietary fiber produce markedly different effects on colon carcinogenesis. Although some fibers exhibit protective properties, others clearly promote tumor development. The mechanisms behind these opposing actions require further investigation. However, one thing is clear and that is that dietary fibers do modulate the carcinogenic process and as such provide a valuable tool for probing the mechanisms and stages of colon tumor development. Dietary fiber appears to play a major role in the regulation of normal intestinal function and in the maintenance of a healthy intestinal mucosa. Although there is some evidence that a fiber-deficient diet predisposes to colon carcinogenesis, it is still not known whether an increase in fiber consumption will prevent the development of colon cancer. This is further complicated by not knowing what constitutes a normal level of fiber intake. In the interim, physicians should perhaps advise their patients to consume a moderate diet that contains vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. This will provide a varied source of fiber-containing foods and if consumed in sufficient quantity will optimize intestinal transit and bulk according to individual needs. Isolated fiber supplements have not been shown to be effective in colon cancer prevention. Further attempts to be more specific about what type of fiber to recommend seem premature at this time. However, an intake in the range of 20 to 35 gm per day of dietary fiber from foods has recently been recommended by an Expert Panel.",Colon_Cancer

"We report a rare case of thyrotoxicosis in a patient with anaplastic thyroid cancer. A 65-yr-old male presented with a 2-d history of rapidly enlarging neck mass and back pain. Physical examination revealed a large, hard thyroid mass and resting tachycardia. He did not have any symptoms suggestive of airway compression at presentation. Thyroid hormone levels were consistent with a hyperthyroid state. CT scan of the neck and thorax showed a heterogeneous mass replacing the thyroid, bilateral pulmonary nodules, and a metastasis with pathological fracture at the level of T-8. Technetium-pertechnetate scan failed to show any uptake in the region of the thyroid. Fine needle aspiration of the thyroid revealed anaplastic thyroid cancer. The patient was started on steroids and radiation therapy of his spine lesion. Brief surgical exploration of the thyroid revealed extensive local infiltration of adjacent neck tissues and marked tumor necrosis.

"Mesenchymal cells in the intestine comprise a variety of cell types of diverse origins, functions, and molecular markers. They provide mechanical and structural support and have important functions during intestinal organogenesis, morphogenesis, and homeostasis. Recent studies of the human transcriptome have revealed their importance in the development of colorectal cancer, and studies from animal models have provided evidence for their roles in the pathogenesis of colitis-associated cancer and sporadic colorectal cancer. Mesenchymal cells in tumors, called cancer-associated fibroblasts, arise via activation of resident mesenchymal cell populations and the recruitment of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and fibrocytes. Cancer-associated fibroblasts have a variety of activities that promote colon tumor development and progression; these include regulation of intestinal inflammation, epithelial proliferation, stem cell maintenance, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodeling, and metastasis. We review the intestinal mesenchymal cell-specific pathways that regulate these processes, with a focus on their roles in mediating interactions between inflammation and carcinogenesis. We also discuss how increasing our understanding of intestinal mesenchymal cell biology and function could lead to new strategies to identify and treat colitis-associated cancers.",Colon_Cancer

Cancer vaccines have also been explored in the past with marginal success. Identification of optimal candidate neoantigens may improve cancer vaccine efficacy and may pave the way to personalized immunotherapy, alone or in combination with other immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint blockade. Understanding the steps in immune recognition and eradication of cancer cells is vital to understanding why previous immunotherapies failed and how current therapies can be used optimally.

"The availability of a limited operation for the treatment of primary lung cancer was discussed on 67 cases who underwent either wedge resection or segmentectomy. The reasons for the application of limited operation were mainly cardiopulmonary failures such as hypertension, abnormal finding on the ECG and obstructive ventilatory failure including the elderly over 70 years of age. Favorable prognosis of a limited operation was obtained in T1N0 and T2N0 cancer when compared to those who underwent lobectomy. Improved prognosis following a limited operation was more attributable to N-factor rather than T. Furthermore, early postoperative course and performance status after a limited operation were more favorable rather than lobectomy. In particular, on the first day of a limited operation, hemodynamic changes in an increased afterload of the right ventricle and reduced left ventricular work tend to minimize in patients with a limited operation. An experimental study also elucidated the advantage of this operative procedure in terms of cardiac function after one or bilobectomy on coronary diseased dogs whose descending coronary artery was made to be a 50% stenosis. In conclusion, it was emphasized that a limited operation should be indicated for patients with T1N0 and T2N0 cancers of primary lung cancer and limited cardiopulmonary function.",Lung_Cancer
"The paper gives the view of the author who is based on his many-year experience in studying a role of radiation diagnosis of colon cancer. It shows it necessary to enhance the significance of radiation diagnosis. More attention should be given to the traditional section on the current radiation study of the large bowel: to irrigoscopy and single double contrasting. By taking into account the labor-consumption of irrigoscopy, the author suggests that the procedure should be simplified without losing its diagnostic capacities. However, he considers single double contrasting of the bowel to be the optimum technique of traditional X-ray study of the bowel in detecting its tumors. Pneumocolonoscopy and iliocecal node study of the ileocecal angle are given in the paper as supplementary techniques of traditional X-ray study of the large bowel. Emphasis is also placed on the role of radiation diagnostic techniques, such as ultrasound diagnosis, X-ray computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. By highly appreciating their significance in the diagnosis of colon cancer, the author believes that they should play a role of important, but additional ways of detecting this pathology. By pointing out the excellent capacities of fibrocolonoscopy, as applied to the problem discussed in the paper, the author does emphasize the certain limitations of this technique, by taking into account that its application can cause some complications. The author's opinion that the obvious increase in the incidence of endophytic carcinomas drastically enhances the role of their radiation diagnosis, but by obligatorily correcting currently available principal methodic and semiotic directives, runs through the entire paper.",Colon_Cancer
"The accumulation of genetic alterations in driver genes is responsible for the development and malignant progression of colorectal cancer. Comprehensive genome analyses have revealed the driver genes, including APC, KRAS, TGFBR2, and TP53, whose mutations are frequently found in human colorectal cancers. Among them, the p53 mutation is found in ~60% of colorectal cancers, and a majority of mutations are missense-type at 'hot spots', suggesting an oncogenic role of mutant p53 by 'gain-of-function' mechanisms. Mouse model studies have shown that one of these missense-type mutations, p53 R270H (corresponding to human R273H), causes submucosal invasion of intestinal tumors, while the loss of wild-type p53 has a limited effect on the invasion process. Furthermore, the same mutant p53 promotes metastasis when combined with Kras activation and TGF- suppression. Importantly, either missense-type p53 mutation or loss of wild-type p53 induces NF- B activation by a variety of mechanisms, such as increasing promoter accessibility by chromatin remodeling, which may contribute to progression to epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These results indicate that missense-type p53 mutations together with loss of wild-type p53 accelerate the late stage of colorectal cancer progression through the activation of both oncogenic and inflammatory pathways. Accordingly, the suppression of the mutant p53 function via the inhibition of nuclear accumulation is expected to be an effective strategy against malignant progression of colorectal cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"The study of thyroid cancer background diseases in hospitals of Republic of Armenia was carried out. 529 cases of primary thyroid cancer were studied from 1999 to 2011. It was found that in women, concomitant thyroid pathology is more common than in men (p<0.05). The morphological verification of any nodules in the thyroid gland is necessary. Thyroid cancer can occur on the background of benign thyroid diseases, but this is no reason for regarding these as a precancerous conditions. According to the results of this study, the incidence of hidden carcinomas is the same, as revealed on the background of benign Thyroid diseases and without the benign nodes. One of the most important prognostic factors for long-term survival of patients with thyroid cancer is a timely diagnosis.

"Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system. The initiation of thyroid cancer is often triggered by a genetic mutation in the phosphortidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, such as RAS and BRAF, or by the rearrangement of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase genes such as RET/PTC. The sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway is evolutionarily conserved and plays an important role in the embryonic development of normal tissues and organs. Gene mutations in the Shh pathway are involved in basal cell carcinomas (BCC). Activation of the Shh pathway due to overexpression of the genes encoding the components of this pathway stimulates the growth and spread of a wide range of cancer types. The Shh pathway also plays an important role in cancer stem cell (CSC) self-renewal. GDC-0449 and LDE-225, two inhibitors of this pathway, have been approved for treating BCC and are being tested as a single agent or in combination with other drugs for treating various other cancers.

"Thyroid carcinomas can be sporadic or familial. Familial syndromes are classified into familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), derived from calcitonin-producing C cells, and familial non-medullary thyroid carcinoma, derived from follicular cells. The familial form of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is usually a component of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) IIA or IIB, or presents as pure FMTC syndrome. The histopathological features of tumors in patients with MEN syndromes are similar to those of sporadic tumors, with the exception of bilaterality and multiplicity of tumors. The genetic events in the familial C-cell-derived tumors are well known, and genotype-phenotype correlations well established. In contrast, the case for a familial predisposition of non-medullary thyroid carcinoma is only now beginning to emerge. Although, the majority of papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas are sporadic, the familial forms are rare and can be divided into two groups. The first includes familial syndromes characterized by a predominance of non-thyroidal tumors, such as familial adenomatous polyposis and PTEN-hamartoma tumor syndrome, within others. The second group includes familial syndromes characterized by predominance of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), such as pure familial PTC (fPTC), fPTC associated with papillary renal cell carcinoma, and fPTC with multinodular goiter. Some characteristic morphologic findings should alert the pathologist of a possible familial cancer syndrome, which may lead to further molecular genetics evaluation.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Robotic surgery has been slow to be fully accepted in the world of pediatric urology largely because of its initial application directed towards adult use and because of the inherent high cost associated with it.

As the adoption of robotic surgery in children has become more widespread, its use has been applied to a broader spectrum of procedures with similar success rates to standard laparoscopy. These procedures include nephrectomy, heminephrectomy, ureteral reimplantation, and ureteroureterostomy.

"Receptor tyrosine kinases play important roles in the biology of many tumor cell types. In approximately 10% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients mutational activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) results in tumor cells that are exquisitely addicted to signaling by this receptor. (1) Thus expression of mutant active EGFR but in general not wild-type EGFR predisposes NSCLC cells to inhibitors of EGFR/ErbB2. Use of EGFR inhibitory agents such as gefitinib for this subset of NSCLC patients causes tumor regression and disease stabilization for 12-18 mo, after which tumor cells become resistant to the drug. (2) Initial studies identified a second mutation within the EGFR, which results in the resistance of the tyrosine kinase to gefitinib, as a major cause of reduced tumor control. (3) This has resulted in the development of newer EGFR inhibitors, e.g., afatinib, which inhibited double mutant EGFR. (4) In a subset of these patients, however, resistance to gefitinib was not associated with EGFR mutations. (5) Clearly, other mechanisms of gefitinib resistance must be at play.",Lung_Cancer

"Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy. While surgery remains the mainstay of the treatment of all different histologies, for differentiated thyroid cancers, radioactive iodine also plays an important role in management. Once tumor becomes radio-iodine refractory, it needs systemic therapy. Earlier, these tumors had very dismal prognosis. However, with the advancement of technology and research, it has become clear now that thyroid cancer cells are driven by various mutations. Targeting these oncogenic drivers by various molecules have proven to be effective therapeutic strategy in thyroid cancer. Besides, as in other solid tumors, immunotherapy is also being evaluated in thyroid cancer. While these new therapeutic approaches have revolutionized the treatment on advanced/metastatic thyroid cancer, there are definite challenges which limit their use in common clinical practice. These challenges include higher treatment cost and lack of testing to identify the driver mutations. Moreover, there is still need for further research in thyroid cancers to identify oncogenic targets and agent to act upon them.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in colorectal tumorigenesis in mice was studied by Oshima et al. to determine the effects of COX-2 gene knockouts and a new COX-2 inhibitor. In the study, heterozygous Apcdelta716 knockout mice, a mouse model of human familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), were either crossed to COX-2 gene knockout mice, or fed chow containing the COX-2-selective inhibitor. Apcdelta716 litter mates were used as positive controls, which developed 652+/-198 (SD) polyps at 10 weeks. Introduction of a COX-2 gene mutation, or feeding with the COX-2-selective inhibitor to the Apcdelta716 knockout mice, reduced the number and size of intestinal polyps dramatically. The results provide direct genetic evidence that COX-2 plays a key role in tumorigenesis, and indicate that COX-2-selective inhibitors can be a new class of therapeutic agents for colorectal polyposis and cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"A new mechanism leading to cancer has been delineated in the last two years when genes whose mutations cause susceptibility to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC, have been mapped, cloned, and characterized. The genes involved belong to a family of DNA mismatch repair genes, and the homozygous effects of their mutations lead to a so-called mutator or replication error phenotype characterized by genome-wide mutations most readily detectable as lengthening or shortening of microsatellite repeats in tumor tissue as compared to normal tissue from the same individual. Germline mutations are inherited in a dominant Mendelian fashion causing the multiorgan cancer susceptibility syndrome misnamed HNPCC. Clinically, the molecular characterization of these mutations in affected individuals now allows genotype-phenotype correlations, and a new view of the natural history of the disease may arise. In at risk individuals, it allows predictive testing for cancer susceptibility, enhanced clinical surveillance with the aim of early cancer detection and cure, and preventive measures.",Colon_Cancer
"Among all cancer, lung cancer has the highest rate of mortality in the western world. The persisting grim lung cancer mortality figures argue powerfully for new approaches for controlling this disease such as chemoprevention that has been defined as the use of agents that inhibit or reverse lung carcinogenesis. Carcinogens from cigarette smoke are implicated in about 90% of male and 75-80% of female lung cancer deaths. Confoundingly epidemiologic studies show that only about 15% of heavy smokers will ultimately develop lung cancer. The fact that 85% of heavy smokers will not develop lung cancer points to a variation in individual susceptibility. It also suggests that modulation of susceptibility might be used as a preventive strategy. This review summarizes the outcomes of recent clinical chemoprevention trials and reveals that the chemoprevention approach in lung cancer is still experimental.",Lung_Cancer
"Although fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) remains the mainstay of the preoperative workup of thyroid nodules, it does not provide a diagnosis in up to 20% of nodules. This group of indeterminate lesions, including lesions with cellular atypia, suspicious cytology, and demonstrating a follicular pattern, provides one of the greatest challenges to researchers in thyroid cancer today. Over the last 2 decades, considerable work has been done to find molecular markers to resolve this diagnostic dilemma. This article explores some of the markers including galectin-3, HBME-1, BRAF, RET/PTC, PAX8-PPARgamma, hTERT, telomerase, miRNA, and microarray and multigene assays. Although no one marker has proven to be a panacea, several combinations of markers have shown great promise as an adjunct to FNA.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Thyrotoxicosis with concomitant thyroid cancer is rare and poorly recognized, which may result in delayed diagnosis, inappropriate treatment and even poor prognosis. To provide a comprehensive guidance for clinicians, the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of this challenging setting were systematically reviewed. According to literatures available, the etiologies of thyrotoxicosis with concomitant thyroid cancer were categorized into Graves' disease with concurrent differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) or medullary thyroid cancer, Marine-Lenhart Syndrome with coexisting DTC, Plummer's disease with concomitant DTC, amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis with concomitant DTC, central hyperthyroidism with coexisting DTC, hyperfunctioning metastases of DTC and others. The underlying causal mechanisms linking thyrotoxicosis and thyroid cancer were elucidated. Medical history, biochemical assessments, radioiodine uptake, anatomic and metabolic imaging and ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration combined with pathological examinations were found to be critical for precise diagnosis. Surgery remains a mainstay in both tumor elimination and control of thyrotoxicosis, while anti-thyroid drugs, beta-blockers, 131I, glucocorticoids, plasmapheresis, somatostatin analogs, dopamine agonists, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors should also be appropriately utilized as needed.",Thyroid_Cancer

"After surgical resection of their primary lung cancer, 33 patients were randomized into one of three groups. The first received high-dose methotrexate once per month with citrovorum rescue, for 3 months. The second group were immunized monthly with a homogenate of Freund's complete adjuvant and carefully characterized soluble antigen derived from allogeneic lung cancer cells of appropriate histology, for 3 months. The third group received a combination of methotrexate and immunization monthly, for 3 months. Each patient was monitored immunologically before, during, and after the treatment period, by use of delayed hypersensitivity reactions to recall and cancer antigens, in vitro lymphocyte response to mitogens, and mixed lymphocyte blocking factor activity. The group that received methotrexate showed little change in skin reactivity, a reduction of blocking factor activity, and significant rebound overshoot in in vitro lymphocyte performance. The immunized group showed a tendency to production of blocking factor activity, striking conversion and enhancement of skin reactivity, and little change in in vitro lymphocyte performance. The immunochemotherapy group showed dramatic increases in specific skin reactivity to cancer antigens, up to 2 years after treatment, in vitro lymphocyte rebound overshoot, and reduction of blocking factor activity production. Classic life table analysis of the probability of freedom from metastases in patients with stage-I cancer indicate that the disease-free interval in patients who received methotrexate is longer than in historic and concomitant controls but not as long as in those who received immunization. The best group appear to be those who received combination immunochemotherapy. We emphasize that the small numbers in this pilot study do not yet allow firm conclusions to be made.",Lung_Cancer

"Colon cancer in humans results in considerable morbidity and mortality throughout most of the world. During the twentieth century, there was a rapid rise in colon cancer within modernizing countries that has not been adequately explained, although the role of diet has been widely explored. Previously, we showed that the presence of the endemic Eimeria spp. protozoan in intestinal tissues is associated with regions of low tumorigenesis in the large and small bovine intestine and that an Eimeria surface protein is a potent activator of dendritic cells and a useful immunomodulator, with anti-cancer and anti-viral properties. Therefore, we hypothesize that the persistent presence of such an intestinal protozoan enhances immunosurveillance by elevating the intestinal alert status and that the loss of these organisms could lead to a higher incidence of colon cancer. Preliminary support of this hypothesis derives from the observations that domestic animals, known to maintain this protozoan, have very low colon cancer incidence. We propose that this also may occur in human populations that use human excrement (night soil) as a fertilizer, a practice that serves to complete the life cycle of this type of microbe. We examine some evidence for this hypothesis in Japan's mortality patterns, where we show that colon cancer increased after the cessation of night soil use, but before the change to a western diet. We conclude that this hypothesis, a variation of the hygiene hypothesis, is worth further consideration and continued elaboration.",Colon_Cancer
"The observation that carcinogen exposure is strongly associated with the probability of developing pulmonary neoplasms has suggested for many years that acquired somatic mutations play a key role in the genesis of these environmentally induced cancers. With the advent of new techniques in cytogenetics and in the molecular analysis of DNA extracted from lung tumors, it has now become possible to test this hypothesis and to search for candidate genes that may be targeted by the chronic exposure of these environmental insults. Early work in this field, studying lung tumors of different histologic types, appears to implicate several distinct chromosomal loci (at chromosomes 3p, 13q, 17p, and others), suggesting that sequential genetic events occur during the initiation and progression pathways to pulmonary tumorigenesis. Identifying the candidate gene products and understanding the chronology and stringency of mutational events at these loci will be an essential goal to understanding the cellular basis of lung tumors and for developing strategies for the next generation of diagnostic and therapeutic studies.",Lung_Cancer
"The relationship between cancer and coagulopathy was suggested by Trousseau nearly 150 years ago. Later, it became more evident that oncologic patients are at a higher risk of experiencing thromboembolic events. This can be due to activation of the coagulation system either by neoplastic cells or by prescribed therapies (chemotherapy or surgical procedures). In fact, these events can constitute the first manifestation of cancer, and their recurrence, despite efficient anticoagulation, has been described. The coagulation system is normally activated in order to provide healing. In the presence of neoplasms, this complex system is activated as a response to multiple stimuli and seems to contribute to cancer progression. Activation of the coagulation system has a greater effect on metastatic foci than on the primary tumor. However, most cancer victims die from complications caused by metastasis, which underscores the importance of this theme. In this area, various mechanisms have been described, creating promising perspectives for future treatments. The current success in using low-molecular-weight heparins against small cell lung cancer is encouraging. Although the knowledge of those mechanisms is relatively incipient, many basic research and clinical studies are underway.",Lung_Cancer
"In patients with colon cancer who undergo resection for potential cure, 40% to 60% have advanced locoregional disease and are classified as either stage II or stage III. The role of adjuvant therapy in stage III colon cancer is well defined. The results from the MOSAIC trial (Multicenter International Study of Oxaliplatin/5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin in the Adjuvant Treatment of Colon Cancer) and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project C-07 trial confirm a definite disease-free survival (DFS) benefit with the addition of oxaliplatin to either infusional or bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV). The Xeloda in Adjuvant Colon Cancer Therapy (X-ACT) trial showed capecitabine to be of equivalent clinical benefit to bolus 5-FU/LV. However, adjuvant trials with irinotecan, including Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB 89803), the Pan-European Trial in Adjuvant Colorectal Cancer 3 (PETACC-3), and the French ACCORD trial, have not shown a significant DFS advantage. In contrast, in patients with stage II disease, a small survival benefit of 1% to 5% exists with chemotherapy. Perhaps the analysis of molecular markers in combination with high-risk histopathologic features will help increase patient specificity and identify subsets of patients with stage II colon cancer who will derive a survival benefit with adjuvant therapy. The current Intergroup study stratifying stage II patients based on presence of microsatellite instability and loss of heterozygosity 18q allele will help us better understand the risk versus benefit observed.",Colon_Cancer
"Tumor markers are defined as substances which are produced by cancer cells or non-cancer cells reactive to cancer cells, and reflect the cancer status, such as its presence, characteristics, and volume. Clinically, many tumor markers are useful not only to assess the presence/absence of cancer, the primary site, histology, stage, and recurrence, but also to monitor the anti-cancer therapy. Tumor markers for lung cancer play only supporting roles because of their limited sensitivity and specificity, but they are clinically essential to daily medical oncology.

"Colon cancer cells, like other types of cancer cells, undergo the remodeling of the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis that contributes to cancer cell hallmarks including enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and survival. Colon cancer cells display enhanced store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) compared with their non-cancer counterparts. Colon cancer cells display an abnormal expression of SOCE molecular players including Orai1 and TRPC1 channels, and the stromal interacting molecule (STIM) 1 and 2. Interestingly, upregulation of Orai1 and TRPC1 channels and their contribution to SOCE are associated with cancer malignancy in colon cancer cells. In a specific cellular model of colon cancer, whereas in non-cancer colon cells SOCE is composed of the Ca2+ release activated (CRAC) currents, in colon cancer cells SOCE is composed of CRAC- and cationic, non-selective store operated (SOC) currents. Former SOCs are mediated by TRPC1 channels. Moreover, colon cancer cells also display dysregulation of the expression of 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP3R) that could contribute to the enhanced SOCE. Another important factor underlying the enhanced SOCE is the differential mitochondrial modulation of the CRAC and SOC currents in non-cancer and colon cancer cells. In colon cancer cells, mitochondria take up more Ca2+ that prevent the Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the SOCs, leading to sustained Ca2+ entry. Notably, the inhibition of SOCE in cancer colon cells abolishes their cancer hallmarks. Robust evidence has shown the efficiency of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) to reverse the enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis resistance of cancer cells. In colon cancer cells, both NSAIDs and DFMO decrease SOCE, but they target different molecular components of SOCE. NSAIDs decrease the Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria, limiting their ability to prevent the Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the SOCs that underlie SOCE. On the other hand, DFMO inhibits the expression of TRPC1 channels in colon cancer cells, eliminating their contribution to SOCE. The identification of players of SOCE in colon cancer cells may help to better understand the remodeling of the Ca2+ homeostasis in cancer. Importantly, the use of different pharmacological tools that target different SOCE molecular players in colon cancer cells may play a pivotal role in designing better chemoprevention strategies.",Colon_Cancer

"Cancer risks were studied in 834 thyroid cancer patients given 131I (4,551 MBq, average) and in 1,121 patients treated by other means in Sweden between 1950 and 1975. Record-linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register identified 99 new cancers more than 2 years after 131I therapy [standardised incidence ratio (SIR) = 1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-1.75] vs 122 (SIR = 1.19; 95% CI 0.88-1.42) in patients not receiving 131I. In females treated with 131I overall SIR was 1.45 (95% CI 1.14-1.83) and significantly elevated were noted for tumours of the salivary glands, genital organs, kidney and adrenal gland. No elevated risk of a subsequent breast cancer or leukaemia was noted. SIR did not change over time, arguing against a strong radiation effect of 131I. Organs that were estimated to have received more than 1.0 Gy had together a significantly increased risk of a subsequent cancer following 131I treatment (SIR = 2.59; n = 18). A significant trend was seen for increasing activities of 131I with highest risk for patients exposed to greater than or equal to 3,664 MBq (SIR = 1.80; 95% CI 1.20-2.58). No specific cancer or group of cancers could be convincingly linked to high-dose 131I exposures since SIR did not increase after 10 years of observation. However, upper confidence intervals could not exclude levels of risk that would be predicted based on data from the study of atomic bomb survivors. We conclude that the current practice of extrapolating the effects of high-dose exposures to lower-dose situations is unlikely to seriously underestimate radiation hazards for low LET radiation.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Thyroid cancer is an uncommon childhood malignancy that presents primarily in young children or adolescent females and may be related to radiation exposure or genetic predisposition. Gene alterations, such as RET mutation or RET/PTC rearrangement, are not uncommon.

Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for thyroid cancer followed by radioactive iodine when appropriate. In patients with MEN2, prophylactic thyroidectomy is recommended, although a delay in the initial diagnosis is common.

"Splenic metastasis from lung cancer is a rare clinical event, most often diagnosed at the time of autopsy. We report 2 cases of splenic metastasis with a primary lung cancer. The first case was a 76-year-old man presenting with a recurrent solitary splenic metastasis 14 months after surgical removal of a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. The second patient was a 72-year-old woman who had a poorly differentiated carcinoma of the lung and multiple abdominal metastasis. We also investigated 267 autopsy cases of lung cancer from 1975 to 1992. Histologically, there were 73 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, 123 adenocarcinoma, 29 large cell carcinoma, 36 small cell carcinoma, and 7 other miscellaneous tumours. The number of splenic metastasis from lung cancer in these cases was 15 (5.6%). Splenic metastasis from a primary cancer of the left lung was more frequent than that from the right lung. Nine of 15 splenic metastases were smaller than 1 cm in size. Splenic metastasis was associated with liver and pancreas metastasis.

"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent cancers affecting humans, with a complex genetic and environmental aetiology. Unlike cancers with known environmental, heritable, or sex-linked causes, sporadic CRC is hard to foresee and has no molecular biomarkers of risk in clinical use. One in twenty CRC cases presents with an established heritable component. The remaining cases are sporadic and associated with partially obscure genetic, epigenetic, regenerative, microbiological, dietary, and lifestyle factors. To tackle this complexity, we should improve the practice of colonoscopy, which is recommended uniformly beyond a certain age, to include an assessment of biomarkers indicative of individual CRC risk. Ideally, such biomarkers will be causal to the disease and potentially modifiable upon dietary or therapeutic interventions. Multi-omics analysis, including transcriptional, epigenetic as well as metagenomic, and metabolomic profiles, are urgently required to provide data for risk analyses. The aim of this article is to provide a perspective on the multifactorial derailment of homeostasis leading to the initiation of CRC, which may be explored via multi-omics and Gut-on-Chip analysis to identify much-needed predictive biomarkers.",Colon_Cancer
"Human thyroid tumors can be derived either from epithelial follicular cells or from parafollicular C-cells. Follicular cell-derived tumors represent a wide spectrum of lesions, ranging from benign adenomas through differentiated (follicular and papillary) and undifferentiated (anaplastic) carcinomas, thus providing a good model for finding a correlation between specific genetic lesions and histologic phenotype. Follicular adenomas and carcinomas show frequently the presence of mutations in one of the three ras genes. Papillary carcinomas show frequently a specific gene rearrangement which gives rise to the formation of several types of so-called RET/PTC chimeric genes. This lesions occur in almost 50% of papillary cancers and consist in the juxtaposition of the 3' or tyrosine kinase domain of the RET gene (which codes for a receptor protein not normally expressed in follicular thyroid cells) with the 5' domain of ubiquitously expressed genes, which provide the promoter and dimerization functions, necessary for the constitutive activation of RET/PTC proteins. Anaplastic carcinomas are frequently associated with mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor. Finally, point mutations of the RET gene are found in familial endocrine syndromes (FMTC; MEN2A and MEN2B), a common feature of which is the medullary thyroid carcinoma, a malignant tumor derived from parafollicular C-cells.",Thyroid_Cancer

"A CpG island DNA methylator phenotype has been postulated to explain silencing of the hMLH1 DNA mismatch repair gene in cancer of the microsatellite mutator phenotype. To evaluate this model, we analyzed methylation in CpG islands from six mutator and suppressor genes, and thirty random genomic sites, in a panel of colorectal cancers. Tumor-specific somatic hypermethylation was a widespread age-dependent process that followed a normal Gaussian distribution. Because there was no discontinuity in methylation rate, our results challenge the methylator phenotype hypothesis and its hypothetical pathological underlying defect. We also show that the mutator phenotype dominates over the gradual accumulation of DNA hypermethylation in determining the genotypic features that govern the phenotypic peculiarities of colon cancer of the mutator pathway.",Colon_Cancer

Cybersecurity (CS) is a contemporary field for research and applied study of a range of aspects from across multiple disciplines. A cybersecurity expert has an in-depth knowledge of technology but is often also recognized for the ability to view technology in a non-standard way. This paper explores how CS specialists are both a combination of professional computing-based skills and genetically encoded traits. Almost every human behavioral trait is a result of many genome variants in action altogether with environmental factors. The review focuses on contextualizing the behavior genetics aspects in the application of cybersecurity. It reconsiders methods that help to identify aspects of human behavior from the genetic information. And stress is an illustrative factor to start the discussion within the community on what methodology should be used in an ethical way to approach those questions. CS positions are considered stressful due to the complexity of the domain and the social impact it can have in cases of failure. An individual risk profile could be created combining known genome variants linked to a trait of particular behavior using a special biostatistical approach such as a polygenic score.

"The staging of lung cancer is a continuously progressing field, with advances in technology not only improving prognostic accuracy, but fundamentally changing pre-operative investigation algorithms. Noninvasive staging is currently undergoing revolutionary developments with the advent of Positron Emission Tomography, whereas Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery has already been established as an essential, minimally invasive diagnostic tool for invasive histological staging. Molecular staging may transform future lung cancer staging, promising extremely accurate substaging, and potentially prompting a revision of our anatomically based conceptualization of lung cancer spread. This review presents an appraisal of current lung cancer staging modalities, and presents an overview of recent developments in molecular staging.",Lung_Cancer
"Classification of thyroid cancer of follicular origin. The 2017-WHO histological classification individualizes 4 groups of differentiated thyroid cancer of follicular origin: papillary the most frequent with several subtypes, follicular, oncocytic and poorly differentiated. This histological classification is closely related to genomic abnormalities found in these cancers. Initial estimate of the risk of cancer related death is based on the TNM classification and that of the risk of recurrence on the American Thyroid Association stratification; these two risk estimates will guide the extent of initial treatment. Then, a dynamic classification that can be modified at each work-up will appreciate the tumoral status and thus the risk of recurrence and of cancer related death.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Direct upper airway infiltration by thyroid neoplasia is a rare occurrence, a unique case of papillary thyroid neoplasia presenting as a pyriform fossa mass is described and the management of these problem patients is discussed, emphasising the controversy between radical and conservative surgery.

"For centuries, designers and engineers have looked to biology for inspiration. Biologically inspired robots are just one example of the application of knowledge of the natural world to engineering problems. However, recent work by biologists and interdisciplinary teams have flipped this approach, using robots and physical models to set the course for experiments on biological systems and to generate new hypotheses for biological research. We call this approach robotics-inspired biology; it involves performing experiments on robotic systems aimed at the discovery of new biological phenomena or generation of new hypotheses about how organisms function that can then be tested on living organisms. This new and exciting direction has emerged from the extensive use of physical models by biologists and is already making significant advances in the areas of biomechanics, locomotion, neuromechanics and sensorimotor control. Here, we provide an introduction and overview of robotics-inspired biology, describe two case studies and suggest several directions for the future of this exciting new research area.",Generic
"Papillary thyroid cancer is predominantly a sporadic disease that usually presents as an asymptomatic thyroid mass in a euthyroid patient. Irradiation to the neck during childhood significantly increases the subsequent risk of this cancer; the prognosis for radiation-related cancers is similar to spontaneous cases. Physical examination, thyroid scanning and ultrasound, and fine-needle aspiration are used to differentiate between benign lesions and papillary thyroid cancer. Near-total thyroidectomy with postoperative radioiodine ablation is currently advocated for most patients, and has excellent results with regard to survival. In children, papillary thyroid cancer often presents with extensive regional disease as well as diffuse lung metastases. Surgery and radioiodine are very effective in such cases, and survival remains excellent. As late recurrences may occur, patients require regular long-term follow-up regardless of the extent of initial disease.",Thyroid_Cancer
"There is no evidence that natural radiation (cosmic radiation or from natural radioiosotopes) increases the risk for thyroid diseases. Moreover, while it has been proven that exposure to external medical radiation or to external and internal radiation by atomic bomb explosions leads to an increased risk for thyroid cancer, the medical use of radioiodine, namely diagnostic and therapeutic application of (1)(3)(1)I, is safe and does not induce thyroid cancer. Exposure of children aged less than 4 years to fallout from the Chernobyl reactor accident has led to a substantial increase of childhood cancer incidence in the countries affected (Belarus, Ukraine and Western parts of Russia). Up to now, the total number of cases in children and adolescents adds up to approximately 5,000; in the next 50 years, approximately 15,000 additional thyroid cancer cases in this age group are expected. With respect to the Chernobyl effects on adults, there is no proven radiation related increase of the thyroid cancer incidence. As can be proven by a therapy project in 247 children with advanced thyroid cancer from Belarus, the prognosis for this tumor, even when metastasized, is good, this being in accordance with literature data indicating mortality rates between 1 and 2%.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The past decade has seen an enormous advancement in the therapy for lung cancer, predominantly seen in adenocarcinoma, ranging from the introduction of histology-based drugs to the discovery of targetable mutations. These events have led to a personalized therapeutic approach with the delivery of drugs that target specific oncogenic pathways active in a given tumor with the intent of acquiring the best response rate. The discovery of sensitizing mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene as the basis for clinical response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors led to a systematic search for other molecular targets in lung cancer. Currently, there are several molecular alterations that can be targeted by experimental drugs. These new discoveries would not be possible without a parallel technological evolution in diagnostic molecular pathology. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a technology that allows for the evaluation of multiple molecular alterations in the same sample using a small amount of tissue. Selective evaluation of targeted cancer genes, instead of whole-genome evaluation, is the approach that is best suited to enter clinical practice. This technology allows for the detection of most molecular alteration with a single test, thus saving tissue for future discoveries. The use of NGS is expected to increase and gain importance in clinical and experimental approaches, since it can be used as a diagnostic tool as well as for new discoveries. The technique may also help us elucidate the interplay of several genes and their alteration in the mechanism of drug response and resistance.",Lung_Cancer
"Altered cellular immune function has been demonstrated in patients with lung cancer, including decreased numbers of circulating lymphocytes and changes in the percentage of lymphocytes in various functional subsets. We quantitated lymphocyte subsets in 54 patients with lung cancer including patients with limited (stages 1 and 2) nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n = 23), advanced (stage 3) NSCLC (n = 16), and small cell cancer (SCLC, n = 15). Serum albumin was decreased in 15 lung cancer patients, and lymphocyte subsets were separately evaluated in these patients. Lymphocyte populations in cancer patients were compared to those of nonsmokers and a smoking patient population. No difference from smokers was noted in patients with limited NSCLC. Patients with SCLC and advanced NSCLC had significantly decreased numbers of T-helper and T-suppressor cells (p less than 0.05). Patients with lung cancer and hypoalbuminemia had the greatest decrease in number of circulating T-helper cells (p less than 0.001). B-lymphocytes were also decreased in patients with advanced NSCLC and patients with hypoalbuminemia (p less than 0.05). A decrease in population of T-lymphocytes subsets is frequent in patients with SCLC, advanced NSCLC, and lung cancer patients with hypoalbuminemia.",Lung_Cancer
"Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common type of endocrine malignancy and accounts for nearly 3% of all malignancies. The incidence of TC in Spain was 5/100,000 in women and 1.9/100,000 in men in 2013. The diagnosis of TC usually follows the identification of a thyroid nodule on physical examination or as an incidental finding on diagnostic imaging performed for other reasons. In most of the cases, the prognosis is excellent but despite low mortality rates, local recurrence occurs in up to 20%, and distant metastases can occur in approximately 10% at 10 years. The better knowledge of molecular biology of TC has allowed to the development of new targeted agents directed to the main pathways involved in TC pathogenesis. Knowing all these new strategies will help us face the therapeutic management of TC more effectively.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Differentiated thyroid cancer is characteristically associated with an innocuous clinical course, but a minority of cases may manifest surprisingly aggressive behaviour. Such aggressive DTC are directly responsible for the majority of thyroid cancer related deaths. Moreover, they contribute indirectly to increased DTC-related morbidity, because our inability to differentiate these tumours from innocuous DTC at an early stage fuels a significant degree of DTC overtreatment around the globe. In the present paper we describe how improved understanding of the clinicopathological thyroid tumour progression model and optimization of clinical staging systems continues to improve our ability to diagnose and treat aggressive DTC. Early recognition of aggressive DTC allows instillation of an aggressive management strategy which is based upon surgical-oncologic completeness, and minimization of treatment-related sequelae through continued development of reconstructive options and focussed delivery of adjuvant treatments.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Dietary fat in general, and perhaps animal and polyunsaturated fats in particular, appear to increase colon carcinogenesis in animal models and epidemiologic studies. This observation holds the potential to shed light on the underlying mechanisms of colorectal carcinogenesis and reduce morbidity and mortality from the disease by dietary and chemoprevention. While research continues into the relationship between prostglandins and other putative mediators of the effects of fats on the colon, we can suggest that a diet which protects against colorectal cancer would be low in fat with most of that fat coming from vegetable sources. Prospective dietary trials are ongoing which may strengthen or modify these preliminary recommendations.",Colon_Cancer

Cybersecurity, information security, and information assurance principles are, therefore, vital for clinical laboratories to fully prepare for what has now become inevitable, future cyberattacks.",Generic
"Metastatic dissemination of differentiated cancer was studied in a personal group with the following results. Invasion of cancer to adjacent structures can be encountered even in children with typical increase with age. The lymphatic spread to regional lymph nodes is typical of papillary cancers and in young patients. The same type of spread without the age-dependent decrease can also be proved, with lower incidence, in follicular cancers. Pulmonary metastases are frequently the only type of distant metastases and may originate from previous spread to lymph nodes. The isolated bone metastases a;e probably brought about through the vertebral venous system. Patients having multiple bone metastases or both bone and lung lesions are probably the only typical examples of metastasizing through the systemic blood flow. As the above types of distant metastases carry different prognosis they should also be recognized by the TNM system.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Laser scanning microscopy has inherent tradeoffs between imaging speed, field of view (FOV), and spatial resolution due to the limitations of sophisticated mechanical and optical setups, and deep learning networks have emerged to overcome these limitations without changing the system. Here, we demonstrate deep learning autofluorescence-harmonic microscopy (DLAM) based on self-alignment attention-guided residual-in-residual dense generative adversarial networks to close the gap between speed, FOV, and quality. Using the framework, we demonstrate label-free large-field multimodal imaging of clinicopathological tissues with enhanced spatial resolution and running time advantages. Statistical quality assessments show that the attention-guided residual dense connections minimize the persistent noise, distortions, and scanning fringes that degrade the autofluorescence-harmonic images and avoid reconstruction artifacts in the output images. With the advantages of high contrast, high fidelity, and high speed in image reconstruction, DLAM can act as a powerful tool for the noninvasive evaluation of diseases, neural activity, and embryogenesis.",Generic

In most respects age, bronchoscopic appearances, histological type, and symptoms the two groups are similar. A high incidence of dyspnoea in the miners was attributed to the concurrence of chronic bronchopulmonary disease. A striking feature was the lower frequency with which lung cancer in miners was found to be operable. It was suggested that the lower frequency of lung cancer in miners is related to an enhancement of the state of immunological preparedness in the lung related to the immune component in the pathogenesis of pneumoconiosis. The differences in lung cancer between miners and non-miners may be partially explained in this way.",Lung_Cancer

"Although surgical resection is still the only curative maneuver in the treatment of colon cancer, efforts of the past decades have proved that systemic chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting definitely improves the curative rate for those patients with localized colon cancer. The combination of the 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) remains the reference treatment. However, the advantage of infusional 5-FU/LV with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant treatment may change the paradigm soon. Capecitabine may be considered as an alternative to 5-FU/LV in the adjuvant therapy of stage III colon cancer. The clinical benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for localized node negative (stage II) disease is definite but small, even though there is yet no universal consensus. Novel molecular and biologic-oriented agents are being studied. Further analysis and definition of prognostic and predictive markers may allow future adjuvant therapy to be individualized.",Colon_Cancer

"Patients are not at risk of dying from a tumor that has been removed; they are at risk of dying from residual microscopic disease not removed at the time of operation. Thus, the goal of an adjuvant treatment, be it chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or dietary and lifestyle manipulations, is to eradicate any residual, albeit microscopic, metastatic disease that might remain. Stage I disease carries an excellent prognosis, and at present there are no compelling data to support adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with this early stage. Stage II colon cancer also has a good prognosis after operation alone and represents the most complicated and contentious area in decisions regarding the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. Stage III colorectal cancer (TanyN M ) represents a group at a higher risk of recurrence, and this population is routinely given adjuvant chemotherapy in the absence of a medical or psychiatric contraindication.",Colon_Cancer

"Cybersecurity threats are estimated to cost the world US $6 trillion a year by 2021, and the number of attacks has increased five-fold after COVID-19. Although there is substantial literature on the threats technological vulnerabilities have on the health care industry, less research exists on how pandemics like COVID-19 are opportunistic for cybercriminals. This paper outlines why cyberattacks have been particularly problematic during COVID-19 and ways that health care industries can better protect patient data. The Office for Civil Rights has loosened enforcement of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which, although useful in using new platforms like Zoom, has also loosened physical and technical safeguards to cyberattacks. This is especially problematic given that 90% of health care providers had already encountered data breaches. Companies must implement well-defined software upgrade procedures, should use secure networks like virtual local area networks, and conduct regular penetration tests of their systems. By understanding factors that make individuals, health care organizations, and employers more susceptible to cyberattacks, we can better prepare for the next pandemic.",Generic

Questions remain, particularly with respect to recurrence and survival outcomes. All current clinical trials should be viewed as early and inconclusive, despite optimism expressed by some and pessimism by others.

"During the last 2 decades, substantial progress has been made in understanding the relationship between dietary constituents and the development of colon cancer in man. Unlike studies of cancer among smokers and nonsmokers, nutritional epidemiologic studies are confronted with the inherent difficulty of assessing reasonably precise exposures. The lack of consistency between international correlation studies and case-control studies does not necessarily negate a dietary etiology of colon cancer because these inconsistencies may have arisen, at least in part, from methodological limitations. Some of these deficiencies in epidemiological studies of diet and cancer have been corrected; recent case-control studies demonstrated that high dietary fat is a risk factor for colon cancer development and that an overall increase in intake of foods high in fiber might decrease the risk for colon cancer. The results of epidemiologic studies may be assumed to present conservative estimates of the true risk for cancer associated with diet. The populations with high incidences of colon cancer are characterized by high consumption of dietary fat, which may be a risk factor in the absence of factors that are protective, such as whole-grain cereals and of other high fiber. Laboratory-animal model studies have shown that certain dietary lipids and fibers influence tumorigenesis in the colon. The data of metabolic epidemiological and laboratory-animal model studies are sufficiently convincing with respect to the enhancement of colon cancer by type of fat and protection by certain dietary fibers.",Colon_Cancer
A rare case of asymptomatic cancer of the ascending colon presenting as a subcutaneous groin mass is reported. At the time of right hemicolectomy with resection of the groin mass there was no sign of incontinuity spread or lymph blockage. Sequential determination of carcinoembryonic antigen levels (CEA) in serum reflected the reduction in tumor mass after surgery as well as subsequent recurrences of disease in the groin and in the lung after 2 years. Immunoperoxidase staining of the primary tumor and the metastases showed strong positivity for CEA confirming the origin of the serum CEA. There have been no signs of liver involvement.

"The authors used data on patients aged 30-79 years admitted to the Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo, New York, 1957-1965, to compare the amount of lifetime occupational physical activity for 210 white male patients with cancer of the colon and 276 white male patients with cancer of the rectum to the lifetime occupational physical exercise of 1,431 patients with nonneoplastic nondigestive diseases. The authors found that risk of cancer of the colon increased with increasing amount and proportion of time in jobs involving only sedentary or light work. This relationship was not found for rectal cancer. These findings corroborate those of Garabrant et al. (Am J Epidemiol 1984; 119:1005-14). The strength of the associations presented here and the dose-response relationship indicate that limited physical activity could be an important etiologic factor.

"Thyroid cancer in childhood is a relatively rare condition. Often it shows biological characteristics different from those seen in adults. Based upon 10 cases in our clinic and 57 cases collected from the Japanese literatures, clinical features, pathology, treatment and prognosis of thyroid cancer in childhood are discussed. Pathogenesis is most likely to be related to hormonal changes during adolescence and previous radiation of the neck region. Cervical lymph nodes swelling was the chief complaint in 84.6 per cent of the cases. On the other hand, pulmonary metastases were recognized in the early stages in 33.5 per cent of the cases. Radical excision of the tumor with modified radical neck dissection is the treatment most frequently employed even in the presence of lung metastases. However, hypoparathyroidism and recurrent nerve injuries should be avoided at all cost in view of long life expectancy and the difficulty in treating them satisfactorily. Prognosis could be as good for children as it is for adults except in cases with early lung metastases.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The lack of prospective randomized clinical trials for most management topics in differentiated thyroid cancer forces us to make management recommendations based on retrospective observational data, which are often incomplete, subject to selection bias, and conflicting.

"The analysis of soluble and cellular components of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids might help the diagnosis of a specific tumour. Up to now disease specific humoral constituents have not yet been found. Concerning cellular recovery, BAL can be useful particularly in patients with bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma. The overall diagnostic yield in the case series presently available in the literature ranges from 35 to 69%. We evaluated the usefulness of BAL in the diagnosis of diffuse neoplastic lung lesions. The BAL provided a diagnostic yield in 75.9% of patients with biopsy or autopsy proven neoplasm, the sensitivity varying according to the type and growth pattern of the tumour (93% in bronchioloalveolar carcinoma). BAL can prove useful also in the diagnosis of pulmonary involvement in lymphoproliferative disorders, particularly when the immunologic evaluation of surface markers is performed.

However, the prevalence of non-diagnostic and indeterminate cytology from FNA is still high, approximately thirty percent. Many biomarkers were developed to differentiate between the benign and malignant thyroid nodule. This review summarizes each diagnostic biomarker of differentiated thyroid cancer.

"Cytokines are molecules that influence activation, growth, and differentiation of several target cells. They are proinflammatory mediators, regulate the systemic inflammatory response, playing a crucial role in autoimmune thyroid diseases, and modulate development and growth of both normal and neoplastic thyroid cells. In addition cytokines, as well as chemokines, have been shown to generate antitumor response. In patients with thyroid cancer, cytokines are useful as serum biomarkers, and should be a part of multi-analyte assay in the clinical evaluation of patients with indeterminate fine-needle aspiration cytology. Finally, several cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibiting factor (LIF), and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) are expressed in thyroid cancer cell lines, and they can be used for evaluating the inhibitory effects of several drugs in redifferentiation therapies. This review reports the latest advances in defining the actions of cytokines, and resumes the relationship between cytokines, thyroid diseases and thyroid cancer.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Lung cancer is the second leading cause of death in Brazil, after exclusion of external causes. Registries in the country are not reliable because of under-registration and limited coverage. Incidence rates for Brazil are less then half those for selected areas with good registries. Crude and adjusted incidence and mortality rates for lung cancer are rising, particularly among women. The main reason is the acceleration in tobacco consumption and the spread of smoking among women. At present, approximately 40% of men and 25% of women, 15 years of age or older, are current smokers. In the state of Rio Grande do Sul, where registries are reliable, incidence and mortality for males are similar to US data and the figures for women are rapidly approaching those for men. Occupations associated with risks of exposure to respiratory carcinogens show a rise in the incidence of lung cancer in the industrialized area of S o Paulo. The main occupational risk in Brazil is exposure to mineral dusts, silica, or asbestos. Although about 15 million Brazilians are exposed to pesticides, agricultural workers were not a risk group for lung cancer in a case-control study. Pesticides containing arsenic and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) are banned. In recent years, a trend towards a decrease in male smoking has been noted, but there is still a high tobacco exposure burden in both males and females, with a forecast of a further increase in rates of lung cancer incidence and deaths.

We determined the 20 colon cancer samples mRNA level. Later, we silence SGK2 in colon cancer cells. We found that SGK2 is up-regulated in colon cancer tissue/cells and have positive correlation with cell migration and invasive potential in human colon cancer cell line CACO2 and HCT116. The expression level of SGK2 have positive correlation with expression of mesenchymal marker N-cadherin and Vimentin and negative correlation with the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin in CACO2 and HCT116 cells.

"The development of distant metastasis is the most important predictor of death from thyroid cancer. KiSS-1 is a recently cloned human metastasis suppressor gene whose product, metastin, was recently identified as the endogenous agonist for a novel Gq/11 coupled receptor (metastin receptor). The expression and functional consequences of metastin and the metastin receptor have not been evaluated in thyroid cancer. We measured metastin and metastin receptor mRNA levels in 10 FCs and 13 papillary carcinomas (PCs), 2 benign non-functioning follicular adenomas (FAs), and 11 normal thyroid samples, and evaluated the signaling pathways activated by metastin in ARO thyroid cancer cells that express the metastin receptor endogenously. Paired normal and tumor samples were available for 4 PC and 3 PFC samples. Metastin mRNA was detected in 6/11 normal samples, and 0/2 FA, 2/10 FC, and 9/13 PC samples (p < 0.05 for PC vs. FC). Metastin receptor was not expressed in any normal thyroid or benign FA samples, and was expressed in only a minority (2/10) of FC samples. However, the receptor was expressed in the majority (10/13) of PCs (p = 0.002 for PC vs. normal tissue). Increased levels of metastin receptor were detected in all four PCs compared to adjacent normal tissue. Incubation levels of metastin receptor were detected in all four PCs compared to adjacent normal tissue. Incubation of metastin receptor expressing ARO thyroid cancer cells with metastin resulted in activation of ERK, but not Akt. Taken together, these data suggest a potential role for metastin and/or metastin receptors in modulating the biological behavior of thyroid cancers.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The alpha-radioactive polonium 210 (Po-210) is one of the most powerful carcinogenic agents of tobacco smoke and is responsible for the histotype shift of lung cancer from squamous cell type to adenocarcinoma. According to several studies, the principal source of Po-210 is the fertilizers used in tobacco plants, which are rich in polyphosphates containing radio (Ra-226) and its decay products, lead 210 (Pb-210) and Po-210. Tobacco leaves accumulate Pb-210 and Po-210 through their trichomes, and Pb-210 decays into Po-210 over time. With the combustion of the cigarette smoke becomes radioactive and Pb-210 and Po-210 reach the bronchopulmonary apparatus, especially in bifurcations of segmental bronchi. In this place, combined with other agents, it will manifest its carcinogenic activity, especially in patients with compromised mucous-ciliary clearance. Various studies have confirmed that the radiological risk from Po-210 in a smoker of 20 cigarettes per day for a year is equivalent to the one deriving from 300 chest X-rays, with an autonomous oncogenic capability of 4 lung cancers per 10000 smokers. Po-210 can also be found in passive smoke, since part of Po-210 spreads in the surrounding environment during tobacco combustion. Tobacco manufacturers have been aware of the alpha-radioactivity presence in tobacco smoke since the sixties.",Lung_Cancer
"Thyroid carcinomas represent the most common endocrine malignancy, and several biological markers are proposed according to the different types of this cancer: for papillary cancer, thyroglobulin constitutes an excellent prognostic factor and rearrangements of ret oncogene can be useful in diagnosis. In sporadic medullary carcinoma, calcitonin is a diagnosis marker of choice, and coupled with ACE, can prevent relapse. Regarding familial medullary carcinoma, mutation screening in ret oncogene leads to early detection of new cases.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Recently, a number of novel chemotherapeutic agents under development show consider able promise in the treatment of lung cancer. Optimally, these new agents should exhibit a unique mechanism of action, a favorable toxicity profile in comparison to standard cisplatin-based chemotherapy, significant single agent activity (> 20% response rate, or > 40% 1-year survival rate) and synergistic antitumor effects with cisplatin and/or radiation.

"The biological functions of the p53-related protein kinase (PRPK) remain unclear. We have previously demonstrated that PRPK is phosphorylated by the T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) and that phosphorylated PRPK (p-PRPK) promotes colon cancer metastasis. Here, we analyzed colon adenocarcinomas from 87 patients and found that higher expression levels of p-PRPK were associated with later stages of metastatic dissemination (stage III and IV) as compared with earlier stages (stages I and II). Indeed, levels of p-PRPK were higher in metastatic versus malignant human colon adenocarcinomas. Knocking down PRPK expression attenuated colorectal liver and lung metastasis of colon cancer cells in vivo An in vitro kinase assay indicated that active PRPK does not phosphorylate p53 directly. We found that PRPK phosphorylates survivin, a regulator of colon cancer metastasis. PRPK phosphorylates survivin at Thr34, which is important for survivin stability. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that the PRPK signaling pathway promotes colon cancer metastasis by modulating survivin stability, and that PRPK could be a new prognostic marker for the survival of colon cancer patients. In addition, we identified an FDA-approved bacteriostatic antibiotic, fusidic acid sodium salt (fusidic acid or FA) as an inhibitor of PRPK, and show that FA combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) inhibited PRPK activity and colon cancer metastasis to the lung in mice. We contend that the combination of FA with 5-FU could be an alternative therapeutic strategy to traditional chemotherapy for colon cancer patients with poor prognosis.

"The incidence of thyroid cancer is rapidly increasing, mostly due to the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of differentiated thyroid cancer (TC). The increasing use of potent preclinical models, high throughput molecular technologies, and gene expression microarrays have provided a deeper understanding of molecular characteristics in cancer. Hence, molecular markers have become a potent tool also in TC management to distinguish benign from malignant lesions, predict aggressive biology, prognosis, recurrence, as well as for identification of novel therapeutic targets. In differentiated TC, molecular markers are mainly used as an adjunct to guide management of indeterminate nodules on fine needle aspiration biopsies. In contrast, in advanced thyroid cancer, molecular markers enable targeted treatments of affected signalling pathways. Identification of the driver mutation of targetable kinases in advanced TC can select treatment with mutation targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) to slow growth and reverse adverse effects of the mutations, when traditional treatments fail. This review will outline the molecular landscape and discuss the impact of molecular markers on diagnosis, surveillance and treatment of differentiated, poorly differentiated and anaplastic follicular TC.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Surgical resection is the primary treatment modality for colorectal cancer, and the most powerful tool for assessing prognosis following surgery is pathologic analysis of the resection specimen. Although the parameters that determine the pathologic stage are the strongest predictors of postoperative outcome, a number of additional pathologic features have prognostic significance that is independent of stage. These include: histologic grade; small vessel (lymphatic or venular) invasion; extramural venous invasion; perineural invasion; tumor border configuration; host lymphoid response to tumor, and the status of surgical margins. For specimens in which the radial (circumferential) margin is applicable, surgical clearance around the tumor is also of import. It is self-evident that, compared to data derived from additional assays, prognostic information that can be derived directly from standard histologic sections of a tumor is of the greatest cost-benefit to the patient. In the current era of cost containment, it is essential that surgical pathologists evaluate and report the pathologic features that are of prognostic and/or predictive significance in every case of colorectal cancer and, in turn, that the import of these be understood by the treating physicians.",Colon_Cancer
"Pulmonary nodules of unknown nature may be cancerous and are best treated by early resection. During the past 20 years we have seen 65 patients in whom asymptomatic pulmonary nodules from 5 to 20 mm in diameter were discovered on routine roentgenograms between 1 and 4 years prior to their referral to surgery. These patients have not been investigated for cancer. Instead, they had been 'observed' or treated with antibiotics while their nodules increased in size. At the time of referral, 29 patients had widespread metastases, 28 had locally invasive State III lung cancer, eight had Stage I or Stage II lesions. Only 16 patients had their tumors resected. Sixteen patients (24.6%) survived 1 year or longer; six patients (9.3%) survived more than 2 years. Early resection of all undiagnosed pulmonary nodules is essential. 'Expectant' or antibiotic treatment of these lesions should be condemned. Educational programs for family physicians are urged.",Lung_Cancer

"Exposure to certain industrial agents has been thought to have carcinogenic potential, both for employees who work closely with such agents and for the general population that comes in contact with them. Although case reports, laboratory studies, and epidemiologic analyses help to determine the carcinogenicity of implicated agents, each of these types of investigation has limitations and deficiencies in distinguishing causal from noncausal associations. Asbestos has been linked with bronchogenic carcinoma, but several controversial factors--the degree of risk relative to exposure dose, the synergistic effect of cocarcinogens, and the question of existence of a threshold dose--complicate the understanding of the magnitude of the risk for exposed persons. Several other physical and chemical agents (such as chromium, nickel, and radon) have also been associated with an increased incidence of lung cancer in epidemiologic and animal studies. As with asbestos, the specific type of the agent and exposure conditions are important in determining the degree of carcinogenicity. In studies of exposure to man-made mineral fibers, formaldehyde, and silica, the findings have been inconsistent. Because the degree of health hazard attributable to asbestos and other known and suspected lung carcinogens is controversial, a wide range of opinions exists about the importance of occupational exposures to the overall incidence of lung cancers. Nevertheless, attempting to prevent lung cancers by minimizing or eliminating exposure to carcinogens is preferable to treating existent cases.",Lung_Cancer
"Doxorubicin chemotherapy was performed in 52 patients with thyroid malignancies. Data from 47 patients could be evaluated. 16 remissions and partial remissions were seen, 15 cases had a progressive course, and in 16 patients there was no change of tumour size during the period of treatment. Results of treatment were worse in locally invasive tumour growth and reduced general state of health as well as in anaplastic carcinomas. Results were best in follicular and C-cell carcinomas. The mean survival time of patients responding to treatment was longer than in non-responders. The main indication for treatment is alleviation of tumour symptoms (bone pain, threatening fractures, pressure due to tumour); further indications are anaplastic carcinomas because of their bad prognosis and C-cell carcinomas because of their comparatively satisfactory response.",Thyroid_Cancer
"During the past few decades, the incidence of thyroid cancer has increased substantially in many countries, including the USA. The rise in incidence seems to be attributable both to the growing use of diagnostic imaging and fine-needle aspiration biopsy, which has led to enhanced detection and diagnosis of subclinical thyroid cancers, and environmental factors. The latest American Thyroid Association (ATA) practice guidelines for the management of adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer differ substantially from the previous ATA guidelines published in 2009. Specifically, the problems of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of a disease that is typically indolent, where treatment-related morbidity might not be justified by a survival benefit, now seem to be acknowledged. As few modifiable risk factors for thyroid cancer have been established, the specific environmental factors that have contributed to the rising incidence of thyroid cancer remain speculative. However, the findings of several large, well-designed epidemiological studies have provided new information about exposures (such as obesity) that might influence the development of thyroid cancer. In this Review, we describe the changing incidence of thyroid cancer, suggest potential explanations for these trends, emphasize the implications for patients and highlight ongoing and potential strategies to combat this growing clinical and public health issue.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas (PDTCs) comprise a small subset of heterogeneous thyroid tumors, occupying an intermediate area between well differentiated follicular or papillary carcinoma and anaplastic carcinomas, from both a histopathogenetic and a clinical point of view.

They have a distinct biological behavior, and the classification of these tumors into a separate group appears justified.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy. Most patients with thyroid cancer have a great chance for successful treating. There is, however, a group of patients with poor prognosis. The present researches of thyroid tumor markers have related to permanent diagnostic progress of circulating markers analysis (thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase, calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen), cellular markers determination and interpretation of results, also. A number of molecular markers have been studied. Diagnostic value of some of them, e.g. TSHR, RET Ras, is well known. Others have investigated continually. Overexpression of BRAF, Met, and p53 has been correlated with aggressiveness of the cancer. Markers said to be of prognostic value in thyroid cancer are CD82, c- myc and Plk-1.

The challenges indicated are Cybersecurity and Data privacy in this instance. Additional challenges are set out supported by literature, in researching data security management systems and legal frameworks to ascertaining the types and varieties of valid encryption, data acquisition, policy and outcomes under ISO 27001 and the General Data Protection Regulations. Blockchain, a revolutionary method of storage and immutability, provides a robust storage strategy, and when coupled with a Smart Contract, gives users the ability to form partnerships, share information and consent via a legally-based system of carrying out business transactions in a secure digital domain. Globally, ethical and legal challenges significantly differ; consent and trust in the public and private sectors in deploying such defensive data management strategies, is directly related to the accountability and transparency systems in place to deliver certainty and justice. Therefore, investment and research in these areas is crucial to establishing a dialogue between nations to include health, finance and market strategies that should encompass all levels of society. A framework is proposed with elements to include Big Data, Machine Learning and Visualisation methods and techniques. Through the literature we identify a system necessary in carrying out experiments to detect, capture, process and store data. This includes isolating packet data to inform levels of Cybersecurity and privacy-related activities, and ensuring transparency demonstrated in a secure, smart and effective manner.",Generic

"Radiation oncology, a major treatment modality in the care of patients with malignant disease, is a technology- and computer-intensive medical specialty. As such, it should lend itself ideally to data science methods, where computer science, statistics, and clinical knowledge are combined to advance state-of-the-art care. Nevertheless, data science methods in radiation oncology research are still in their infancy and successful applications leading to improved patient care remain scarce. Here, we discuss data interoperability issues within and across organizational boundaries that hamper the introduction of big data and data science techniques in radiation oncology. At the semantic level, creating common underlying models and codification of the data, including the use of data elements with standardized definitions, an ontology, remains a work in progress. Methodological issues in data science and in the use of large population-based health data registries are identified. We show that data science methods and big data cannot replace randomized clinical trials in comparative effectiveness research by reviewing a series of instances where the outcomes of big data analyses and randomized trials are at odds. We also discuss the modern wave of machine learning and artificial intelligence as represented by deep learning and convolutional neural networks. Finally, we identify promising research avenues and remain optimistic that the data sources in radiation oncology can be linked to yield important insights in the near future. We argue that data science will be a valuable complement to, but not a replacement of, the traditional hypothesis-driven translational research chain and the randomized clinical trials that form the backbone of evidence-based medicine.",Generic
"Lung cancer is a complex problem because there are a number of different histological cell types. Those commonly grouped as bronchogenic carcinoma (epidermoid carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large cell undifferentiated carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and adenosquamous carcinoma) account for more than 90% of the new cases and the deaths each year. The natural history of bronchogenic carcinoma suggests that many years pass while the cancer evolves from a pre-cancerous change in the bronchial mucosa, to undetectable microscopic cancer, to preclinical asymptomatic cancer and finally into a full symptomatic cancer, the phase of most lung malignancies in the tissue at diagnosis. Therefore, students of the aetiology of this disease must consider what has happened to patients 5-20 years before lung cancer is diagnosed.",Lung_Cancer
"The diagnosis and management of follicular carcinoma of the thyroid gland remains a controversial topic. Color-Doppler (CD) imaging has been expected for the differential diagnosis between follicular adenoma and follicular carcinoma. CD imaging examination of follicular tumors has revealed that high-velocity pulsative blood flow penetrating the tumor is a characteristic finding of follicular carcinoma. Real-time tissue elastography (RTE), which enable to demonstrate the tissue elasticity, has begun to be applied for the thyroid disease. In follicular cancer, the difference of elasticity from core of the tumor and periphery is supposed to be depend on the difference of hypercellurality. RTE can provide new useful information for the differential diagnosis of thyroid follicular lesions.",Thyroid_Cancer

"A clinicopathological analysis was carried out on 50 cases of lung cancer with silicosis diagnosed from April 1975 to March 1988. All patients were males and the age distribution ranged from 47 to 85 years with a mean of 63.5 at diagnosis. They had been exposed to silica in tunneling for 3 to 42 years, with an average of 15.1. Forty eight cases smoked. Histologically, squamous cell carcinoma was the most common with 29 cases, followed by 10 small cell carcinomas, 6 adenocarcinomas, 4 large cell carcinomas and one adenosquamous carcinoma. Thirty seven tumors were located in peripheral regions, mostly upper lobe or S6, while 13 tumors were in large bronchi. As the most common histological types of lung cancer with silicosis were squamous cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma, some carcinogens might be involved in tumorigenesis. Silica alone is not considered to be a carcinogen, however, silica containing adsorbed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from cigarette smoking or from industrial pyrolysis can act as a carcinogen or promoter.",Lung_Cancer
"Introduction: Abdominal actinomycosis is a rare granulomatous inflammatory disease caused by a Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium Actinomyces israelii, manifesting as inflammatory mass, or abscess formation. Evolution is slow and steady in inflammatory contiguous extension without limit organ that lends itself to confusion with abdominal malignancies. Methods: We performed a retrospective study on the patients with abdominal actinomycosis operated in the First Surgical Clinic, ""St. Spiridon"" University Hospital Iasi; between 1980 - 2018 there have been 13 cases (4 men and 9 women) with a mean age 44.07 years admitted for abdominal tumors (7 cases) or pelvic inflammatory disease (6 cases). Results: We identified as predisposing factors: IUD maintained over 10 years (6 cases), foreign bodies 2 cases (a toothpick probably perforated colon, gallstones lost in peritoneum), diabetes (3 cases), immunodepression. All cases were operated by laparotomy (9 cases) or laparoscopic approach (4 cases). We describe five of these cases of actinomycosis that had been mimicking a colon cancer: ileo - cecal - 3 cases, transverse colon - one case and on the greater omentum - one case, followed by specific treatment with penicillin, with good evolution. Conclusions: Abdominal actinomycosis should always be included in the differential diagnosis of abdominal tumors. Preoperative diagnosis, difficult but possible, can avoid surgery. Treatment with antibiotics is necessary for the healing of the disease. Postoperative control is mandatory, with relapses possible.",Colon_Cancer

"Cytokines are hormonE-like proteins and peptides involved in the signalling between cells during immune response. They are produced mainly by lymphocytes (lymphokines) and mononuclear phagocytes (monokines). They are involved in both cell-mediated and humoral immunity. Cytokines fall into a number of categories: interferons (IFNs), interleukins (ILs) and growth factors. It has been indicated in cancer immunology the following cytokines are particularly important: IFNs, TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12. Interferons (IFN-gamma in particular) in cooperation with TNF-alpha and IL-1 inhibit proliferation of tumor cells and by their synergic activity with IL-2 induce cytotoxicity of NK-cells. They activate mononuclear phagocytes and by B lymphocyte stimulation augment lysis of cancer cells. TNF-alpha has mainly cytotoxic activity, leading to hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors. It is also an endogenic pyrogen which is together with IL-1 responsible for pyretic status in neoplastic disease. IL-1 stimulates necrotizing activity of TNF-alpha and augments cachexia by anabolism of lipid induction. IL-2, IL-6 and IL-12 induce NK and LAK-cell cytotoxicity. IL-12 inhibits metastasis formation.

"Sera from 171 patients with advanced lung cancer, from 110 normals, and from 123 subjects with benign respiratory diseases were analyzed for 10 substances to detect lung cancer: ferritin, lipid-bound sialic acid, total sialic acid, beta 2-microglobulin, lipotropin, the alpha and beta subunits of human chorionic gonadotropin, calcitonin (two assays), parathyroid hormone, and carcinoembryonic antigen. Individual markers were studied, and optimal combinations of markers were sought for discriminating lung cancer patients from normals and from patients with benign lung disease. Numerous methods for combining the markers were examined, but the methods of logistic regression and recursive partitioning were finally adopted. The best discrimination rules we could find used only carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and total sialic acid (TSA). The performance of these rules was validated on an independent serum panel containing sera from 68 patients with advanced lung cancer, from 40 normals, and from 52 patients with benign respiratory disease. The combination rules based on TSA and CEA performed better than a rule based on CEA alone. Logistic discrimination rules with TSA and CEA that were designed to have 95% specificity achieved 54% sensitivity for discriminating advanced lung cancer from normal controls and 52% sensitivity for discriminating advanced lung cancer from controls with benign disease.

"Lung cancer continues to be one of the most common causes of cancer death despite understanding the major cause of the disease: cigarette smoking. Smoking increases lung cancer risk 5- to 10-fold with a clear dose-response relationship. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke among nonsmokers increases lung cancer risk about 20%. Risks for marijuana and hookah use, and the new e-cigarettes, are yet to be consistently defined and will be important areas for continued research as use of these products increases. Other known environmental risk factors include exposures to radon, asbestos, diesel, and ionizing radiation. Host factors have also been associated with lung cancer risk, including family history of lung cancer, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and infections. Studies to identify genes associated with lung cancer susceptibility have consistently identified chromosomal regions on 15q25, 6p21 and 5p15 associated with lung cancer risk. Risk prediction models for lung cancer typically include age, sex, cigarette smoking intensity and/or duration, medical history, and occupational exposures, however there is not yet a risk prediction model currently recommended for general use.

"Epidemiologic and laboratory studies suggest a cancer protective effect and/or lack of a tumor promoting effect by dietary olive oil as compared with other types of non-marine oils. Squalene, a constituent of olive oil, and a key intermediate in cholesterol synthesis may be regarded as partially responsible for the beneficial effects of olive oil, which include decreased mortality rates among populations with high olive oil consumption. Thus, in this study we have assessed the chemopreventive efficacy of squalene on azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF). In addition, we measured the effect of squalene on serum cholesterol levels in the rats. Male F34 rats (5 weeks old) were fed the control diet (modified AIN-76A) or experimental diets containing 1% squalene or 320 p.p.m. sulindac. Two weeks later, all animals except those in vehicle (normal saline)-treated groups were s.c. injected with AOM (15 mg/kg body wt, once weekly for 2 weeks). At 16 weeks of age, all rats were killed, colons were evaluated for ACF and serum was assayed for the cholesterol levels. As expected, dietary administration of sulindac suppressed ACF development and reduced crypt multiplicity, i.e. number of aberrant crypts/focus. Administration of dietary squalene inhibited total ACF induction and crypt multiplicity by approximately >46% (P < 0.001). Further, squalene at a level of 1% did not show any significant effect on serum cholesterol levels. Our finding that squalene significantly suppresses colonic ACF formation and crypt multiplicity strengthens the hypothesis that squalene possesses chemopreventive activity against colon carcinogenesis.",Colon_Cancer

"Identification of new prognostic factors for colon cancer with no lymph node involvement may improve the selection of patients for adjuvant chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to assess the possibility of using gene expression profiling for this purpose. Fifty patients operated on for stage II colon cancer were included. Twenty-five of these patients relapsed, while the other 25 remained disease-free for at least 5 years. MRNA was extracted from fresh-frozen biopsies and hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip HGU133A. One thousand six hundred random splits of the 50 patients into a training set and a validation set were considered. For each split, a prognostic combination was derived from the training set (selection of the 30 genes most differentially expressed between patients who recurred and those who did not, by linear discriminant analysis), and its prognostic performance was assessed with the validation set. On average, accuracy was 76%, sensitivity 85%, and specificity 68%. A total of 6,124 genes were included in at least one of the 1,600 predictive combinations, and 55 genes were included in more than 100 combinations.

For first-line therapy, pembrolizumab is currently the standard of care for patients whose tumors express PD-L1 >50%. All patients with NSCLC should undergo PD-L1 testing before initiating treatment on pembrolizumab. For patients not eligible in the first line, immunotherapy is the standard of care for most in the second line. Nivolumab and atezolizumab are approved in all patients as second-line therapies after platinum-based doublet failure regardless PD-L1 expression level, although pembrolizumab is approved as second-line therapy for those whose tumors express PD-L1 >1%.",Lung_Cancer
Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare malignancy of the thyroid with a high mortality rate. Conventional therapy has not been effective. Several biological agents are being investigated.

"This article briefly reviews the literature supporting the practice of extended pulmonary resection followed by a comprehensive description of the indications, workup, and technique commonly used for patients requiring extended pulmonary resections for advance lung cancers. The article also provides up-to-date advances in the field that have aided in the safe and effective practice of extended pulmonary resections.",Lung_Cancer
"What operation to perform in the case of a patient with thyroid cancer is a controversial issue, because there are few trials of treatments on which to base decisions. Small papillary tumours in young patients can be adequately treated by less than total thyroidectomy as can some variants of follicular carcinoma, but outwith these settings total thyroidectomy is recommended.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Proteins with desired functions and properties are important in fields like nanotechnology and biomedicine. De novo protein design enables the production of previously unseen proteins from the ground up and is believed as a key point for handling real social challenges. Recent introduction of deep learning into design methods exhibits a transformative influence and is expected to represent a promising and exciting future direction. In this review, we retrospect the major aspects of current advances in deep-learning-based design procedures and illustrate their novelty in comparison with conventional knowledge-based approaches through noticeable cases. We not only describe deep learning developments in structure-based protein design and direct sequence design, but also highlight recent applications of deep reinforcement learning in protein design. The future perspectives on design goals, challenges and opportunities are also comprehensively discussed.",Generic
"Sigmoidoscopy screening and fecal occult blood (FOB) tests have been demonstrated as effective ways to reduce mortality from colorectal cancer. However, most studies of colorectal cancer screening and cancer mortality have not taken into consideration lifestyle factors that could account for the observed associations. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between screening and incidence of colon cancer, taking into consideration important lifestyle factors.",Colon_Cancer
"The medical records of inpatients with diagnoses of either ICD-9 193(malignant neoplasm of the thyroid gland) or 226(benign neoplasm of the thyroid gland) in the claims sent in by medical care institutions throughout the country, to the Korea Medical Insurance Corporation (KMIC) during the period from January 1, 1986 to December 31, 1987 were abstracted. These records were abstracted in order to identify and confirm new cases of thyroid cancer among the beneficiaries of the KMIC. Using these data, the incidence rate of thyroid cancer among Koreans was estimated as of July 1, 1986 through June 30, 1987. The crude rates were estimated to be 0.76(95% Cl: 0.63-0.87) and 3.87(95% Cl: 3.60-4.14) per 100,000 in males and females, respectively, and the cumulative rates for the age spans 0-64 and 0-74 in males were 0.06% and 1.10%, respectively. In females, those were equally 0.35%. The age-adjusted rate for the world population was 0.93 per 100,000 in males, which is one of the lowest levels in the world. However, the adjusted rate in females was 3.96 per 100,000, which is an average level and very similar to that of the Chinese in Singapore and Shanghai. A similar tendency was shown in the case of the truncated rates for the age group of 35-64, which was 1.91 per 100,000 in males and 8.82 per 100,000 in females.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Completion pneumonectomy (CP) for second primary/primary lung cancer (SPLC) and local recurrence lung cancer (LRLC) is still controversial. Although several case series on such a practice exist, the oncological benefit is under debate.

"Recent advances have led to improved outcomes in lung transplantation. The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Registry data have shown a steady increase in the number of cases performed annually. Although somewhat controversial, lung transplantation (LTx) for lung cancer has also slowly increased. The current role of LTx for malignant diseases and the management challenge of incidental lung cancer in the explanted lungs are reviewed herein.",Lung_Cancer
"Owing to the young median age of diagnosis, thyroid cancer in women can coincide with pregnancy and affect its management. The evaluation of a thyroid nodule in pregnant women is similar to that in nonpregnant women, but special consideration must be taken for the impact of a cancer diagnosis and its sequelae in pregnancy. The initial comprehensive exam for pregnant and nonpregnant women includes evaluation of the biochemical function and structure of the thyroid gland, and then fine-needle aspiration biopsy of any suspicious nodule. Management diverges after biopsy and diagnosis, as pregnancy affects timing of thyroidectomy and radioiodine exposure. Owing to the indolent nature of differentiated thyroid cancers, surgery can often be delayed to the immediate postpartum period without change in recurrence or mortality rate. However, for more aggressive thyroid cancers or if the patient wishes to pursue surgery during pregnancy, a discussion about maternal health, fetal risk, and disease prognosis is needed between the physician and patient. This review serves to discuss the evaluation of the thyroid nodule and management of thyroid cancers in the pregnant population, as well as address thyroid cancer surveillance in pregnant women with a previous history of thyroid cancer.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Robotic approaches have seen significant growth in the last 5 years. Taking advantage of three-dimensional visualization, improved articulation, and multiple operating arms provides theoretical and real advantages in colorectal cancer surgery.

"In many cancers, varying regions within the tumor are often phenotypically heterogeneous, including their metabolic phenotype. Further, tumor regions can be metabolically compartmentalized, with metabolites transferred between compartments. When present, this metabolic coupling can promote aggressive behavior. Tumor metabolism in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is poorly characterized.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Thyroid cancer is very rare during pregnancy, but a thyroid nodule is more likely to be cancerous if discovered during pregnancy (43 p. cent versus 15 p. cent). The diagnosis is more difficult. Tests using radioactive substances are contraindicated during pregnancy. Ultrasonography does not permit to specify the nature of the nodule and aspiration biopsy with cytological examination becomes the examination of choice. One should not hesitate to operate on these nodules, during pregnancy, if the diagnosis is made. It is difficult to assert that the prognosis is aggravated by pregnancy since there are so few cases, but several authors report a few cases with an abnormally fast progression during pregnancy. Forms which are properly treated and occurred before the age of 40, are not a contraindication to subsequent pregnancies, if they are not anaplastic or metastatic forms. However, a reasonable delay of the surgery is advised in order to stabilize the hormonal treatment and the calcium-phosphorus balance.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Colon cancer is the most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer mortality in humans. Using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, the current study revealed the accumulation of four uremic toxins (cresol sulfate, cresol glucuronide, indoxyl sulfate, and phenyl sulfate) in the serum of mice harboring adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutation-induced colon cancer. These uremic toxins, likely generated from the gut microbiota, were associated with an increase in the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and a disorder of lipid metabolism. Nutmeg, which exhibits antimicrobial activity, attenuated the levels of uremic toxins and decreased intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(min/+) mice. Nutmeg-treated Apc(min/+) mice had decreased IL-6 levels and normalized dysregulated lipid metabolism, suggesting that uremic toxins are responsible, in part, for the metabolic disorders that occur during tumorigenesis. These studies demonstrate a potential biochemical link among gut microbial metabolism, inflammation, and metabolic disorders and suggest that modulation of gut microbiota and lipid metabolism using dietary intervention or drugs may be effective in colon cancer chemoprevention strategies.",Colon_Cancer
"In this editorial, we comment on the current development and deployment of data science in intensive care units (ICUs). Data in ICUs can be classified into qualitative and quantitative data with different technologies needed to translate and interpret them. Data science, in the form of artificial intelligence (AI), should find the right interaction between physicians, data and algorithm. For individual patients and physicians, sepsis and mechanical ventilation have been two important aspects where AI has been extensively studied. However, major risks of bias, lack of generalizability and poor clinical values remain. AI deployment in the ICUs should be emphasized more to facilitate AI development. For ICU management, AI has a huge potential in transforming resource allocation. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has given opportunities to establish such systems which should be investigated further. Ethical concerns must be addressed when designing such AI.",Generic
"The key priority for obstructed colon cancer (OCC) is urgent resolution of the large bowel obstruction with ideally no compromise of oncological outcomes and low initial and permanent ostomy rates. Proactive management is pivotal to decrease the risk of perforation and septic shock. Staged procedures have an important place to provide optimal treatment and offer similar treatment and outcomes as in the elective setting. The approach is tailored to the patient's condition, the oncological situation and expertise of the available surgical team. This overview concludes by proposing a comprehensive treatment algorithm for individualized treatment of OCC.",Colon_Cancer
"To explore the impact of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) on quality of life (QoL) a clinical analytical framework was developed. Based on the clinical analytical framework, a systematic literature search was performed to identify studies applying patient-reported outcomes (PRO) instruments among patients with DTC. Subsequently, the scope was narrowed down to studies comparing scores on the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short form 36 (SF-36) to a reference population (clinical interpretability criterion). Further, the currently available thyroid cancer (TC) specific QoL PROs were review in accordance with the standards of the International Society of Quality of Life Research. In the initial search, 213 studies were included. The additional 'clinical interpretability'-criteria, limited the final study sample to 16 studies, 13 cross-sectional and 3 longitudinal. QoL was impacted across all SF-36 scales. The impact was generally modest and the impact was impeded by time since diagnosis and treatment. Four TC specific instruments were identified. Generally, the documentation of their measurement properties, particularly content validity and clinical validity, including substantial quantitative validation, was scarce. As was the cross-cultural applicability of the currently available instruments. This restricted, focused, clinically founded review showed an impact on a broad range of QoL issues. There is a need for large-scale measurement of QoL outcome longitudinally, using well-validated PRO instruments in order to identify with certainty the impact on subgroups.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Applying the method of multiple parallel sequencing on the MiSeq platform (Illumina, United States), a comparative analysis of miRNA expression in tumor and normal colon tissuie cells was performed. Forty miRNAs aberrantly expressed in cancer were detected. Among them, 15 and 25 miRNAs showed increased arid decreased expression, respectively, for all or most of the cases. Sixteen miRNA clusters were identified, which showed a coordinated or incompletely coordinated aberrant expression in colorectal cancer cells. In two (miR-183/182 and miR-106b/25) and four (miR-143/145, miR-497/195, miR-30e/30c-1, and miR-30a/30c-2) miRNA clusters, respectively, a statistically significant coordinated increase or decrease in expression was iegistered for all miRNAs withini the corresponding cluster. Three aberrantly expressed well-known miRNAs (miR-100-5p, mil-30d-5p, and miR-204-5p) were identified, which, however, had never 'before been associated with coloreictal cancer. The obtained results demonstrate the potential and promising application of 6 miRNA clusters with' coordinated aberrant expression as markers for colorectal cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"This editorial for the special issue of FutureS is not intended to provide a comprehensive, analytical overview of the future of health care; rather, it collects the perspectives on which scholars have focused most. There is a danger that what we report will quickly become obsolete for numerous reasons; think of the speed of current technological progress or the fact that the Covid-19 pandemic could further stress health care systems around the world. However, we would like to outline some of the current topics explored in the literature and focus on the scenarios envisioned by practitioners. We write this piece being interested in the innovative impulses of all the actors belonging to the ""renewed"" health care ecosystem, aware of the fact that there are significant differences between the countries of the North and South of the world and, consequently, between their health care systems. What we can say with certainty is that the healthcare and life sciences are the protagonists of an unparalleled revolution. The aging population and changing needs, the increasingly common occurrence of chronic disorders, and digitization are some of the challenges facing the sector. The technological change of the fourth industrial revolution is disruptive and changes the logic of the market, not only that of healthcare but also that of adjacent markets. Because of the intensity with which insiders have to face these new trends, the topic has been the focus of interest of scholars and practitioners in recent years. The big players in consulting, as well as the scholars, have deepened the issues of healthcare of the future, focusing on what will be the major challenges in 10 years and imagining potential scenarios that will reconfigure the way health care is delivered and used. In the next 10 years, there will be profound demographic changes and the healthcare system will necessarily have to reconfigure the supply of the necessary services and the methods of delivery (KPMG, 2018). Due to the aging of the population, there has already been a dramatic increase in chronic and degenerative diseases requiring complex treatment in recent years. In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic that has been sweeping the world since 2019 has strained global health systems, revealed already existing weaknesses, even in the most advanced countries, and is representing an important moment of reflection for all policymakers. The whole world is questioning what will need to be done to foster greater effectiveness of national systems as well as better capacity to cope with shocks of such magnitude. In this document we explore what practitioners and scholars consider the main future challenges and the major changes that need to be made in the healthcare sector in order to embrace a new paradigm of care, based on the centrality of the patient, on prevention and not on cure, on technologies at the side of humans.",Generic
"Analysis of thymidine phosphorylase (TP), thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) or their mRNA are now being applied before-the start of chemotherapy to predict the therapeutic efficacy. Although these key enzymes were reported to be basically independent, we found the differences in TS between cancer and adjacent mucosa was reversely correlated with the difference in DPD. We found a significant relationship between TP and DPD in 52 patients with colon cancer. TP and DPD were measured by EIA. Statistical analysis was made non-parametrically using Statview 5.0. TP was significantly higher in cancer (78 +/- 58 U/mg protein) than in the adjacent mucosa (43 +/- 24 U/mg protein). Conversely, DPD was significantly lower in cancer(43 +/- 32 U/mg protein) than in the adjacent mucosa (55 +/- 18 U/mg protein). The amount of TP and DPD in cancer were not correlated with the clinicopathological parameters. TP was significantly (r = 0.70) correlated with DPD in cancer but not in adjacent mucosa. The difference in TP between cancer and adjacent mucosa was significantly (r = 0.69) correlated with the difference in DPD as well. In the colon cancer with low TP, DPD in cancer is lower than in the adjacent mucosa, however, the more TP in cancer increased, the higher the DPD in cancer increased over that in the adjacent mucosa. Modulation of DPD as well as TP may be necessary when high levels of TP or DPD are measured in the cancer tissue. The understanding of the basic relationship among these key enzymes will improve the 5-FU-based chemotherapeutic prediction.",Colon_Cancer
"Targeted biologic therapy remains a very active and evolving field since the US Food and Drug Administration approved cetuximab, a recombinant, human/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody against the endothelial growth factor receptor, and bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth factor, for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Benefits of these reagents in diverse clinic settings combined with different chemotherapeutic agents are being defined. Current research is focused on defining which patients will benefit from these treatments and how best to use them in the clinic. Additional preclinical and clinical studies will enable better usage of these biologic agents and lead to the development of new targeted therapies for the treatment of colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"The economic burden of cancer on the national health expenditure is billions of dollars. The economic cost is measured on direct and indirect medical costs, which vary depending on stage at diagnosis, patient age, type of medical services, and site of service. Costs vary by region, physician behavior, and patient preferences. When analyzing the economic burden of survivors of colon cancer, we cannot forget the societal burden. Post-acute care and readmissions are major economic burdens. People with colon cancer have to be followed for their lifetime. Economic models are being studied to give cost-effective solutions to this problem.",Colon_Cancer
"Thyroidectomy procedures are the mainstay treatment for thyroid cancer and are safe and effective when they are performed by experienced surgeons. Preoperative evaluation of patients with suspected thyroid cancer consists of ultrasonography, radioisotope scanning, and computed tomography scans. Postoperative complications of thyroidectomy procedures include hemorrhage, edema of the glottis, muscle rigidity and spasm (ie, tetany), acute thyrotoxicosis, and damage to the laryngeal nerve. Most surgical patients are discharged home within three days after surgery, and many patients require lifelong thyroid hormone replacement to prevent hypothyroidism.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Bronchoplasty for patients with lung cancer is basically designed to achieve radical cure with the preservation of lung function. Functional lung parenchyma can be preserved, and the reimplanted lobes contribute to postoperative quality of life. Pneumonectomy is associated with a higher occurrence of postoperative complications, poor quality of life, and cardiopulmonary dysfunction as compared with lobectomy. In addition, long-term complications (i.e., late pulmonary hypertension, respiratory failure, or so-called postpneumonectomy syndrome) are sometimes seen after pneumonectomy but seldom after lobectomy. Thus pneumonectomy itself is considered a disease. Sleeve lobectomy, or lobectomy with bronchoplasty, which allows the preservation of functional lung parenchyma with the possible advantages of lower mortality and morbidity rates, is a valid alternative to pneumonectomy and has recently been accepted as a standard treatment in noncompromised patients with lung cancer. Atypical bronchoplasties such as double-sleeve and extended-sleeve lobectomy, and sleeve segmentectomy are also performed at present. This article describes the surgical techniques for bronchoplastic procedures and compares the surgical outcomes of sleeve lobectomy with those of pneumonectomy reported in the literature.",Lung_Cancer
"Radioactive 131I therapy for differentiated thyroid cancer has been used since the 1940s and is an established and effective treatment. In contrast, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) was considered to be effective for achieving local control but not for prolonging survival. Although clinicians were hesitant to administer EBRT owing to the potential radiation-induced adverse effects of 2 dimensional (2D)-radiotherapy until 2000, it is expected that adverse effects will be reduced and treatment efficacy improved through the introduction of more advanced techniques for delivering radiation (eg, 3D-radiotherapy and intensity modulated radiotherapy [IMRT]). The prognosis of undifferentiated thyroid cancer is known to be extremely bad, although in very rare cases, multimodality therapy (total or subtotal resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy) has allowed long-term survival. Here, we report the preliminary results of using hypofractionated radiotherapy for undifferentiated thyroid cancer in our institution.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The results of ACOSOG Z4031 may provide landmark information for the use of proteomic profiling to diagnose lung cancer noninvasively and to provide more accurate predictions of survival. Although the technological developments allowing generalized use of proteomic and genomic analyses are relatively recent, major progress in understanding the molecular basis of lung cancer has been made. Predicting survival is only the first step in the use of proteomics. If a reliable protein profile can be identified that is associated with poor prognosis, these proteins can then be identified and become therapeutic targets. It is not difficult to envision a day when a simple blood test will diagnose a lung cancer, perhaps even before it is clinically apparent, and, at the same time, identify the chemotherapeutic agents to which the tumor is sensitive, allowing individually directed treatment.",Lung_Cancer
"Concurrent chemoradiation has become for the 15 last years the standard treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, either as a definite therapy in non resectable tumors, or in a neoadjuvant setting in potentially resectable tumors. Associating sequential and concurrent schedules, by administering chemotherapy before or after concurrent chemoradiation, has been recently investigated, but the best sequence remains a matter of controversy. Increasing local control and survival after definite chemoradiation seems possible not only by using optimized radiation fractionation schedules and escalated total doses, but also by associating more convenient and less toxic chemotherapy agents at the right cytotoxic or radio-sensitizing dose. Moreover, recent data have suggested that surgery following induction chemoradiation is feasible and effective in selected patients without mediastinal nodes involvement, if a complete resection can be performed. In patients with localized small cell lung cancer, early concurrent chemoradiation with platinium and etoposide has been recognized as the state-of-the-art treatment. The increasing number of ongoing trials including modern radiation schedules combined with newer chemotherapy agents shows that chemoradiation is one of the most promising therapeutic strategies in thoracic oncology.",Lung_Cancer
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastric cancer, ranking as the third and fifth most prevalent global cancers, respectively, have seen increased diagnoses due to advancements in early detection and extended lifespans. Synchronous and metachronous cancers, with a rare incidence, are notable, with CRC being the predominant synchronous occurrence in gastric cancer patients. Screening CRC patients for gastric cancer is debated due to its low incidence, underscoring the crucial role of early diagnosis. Distinguishing between metastatic adenocarcinoma and synchronous tumors is challenging, relying on techniques such as immunohistochemistry. Surgery is the primary treatment for synchronous cancer, with successful single-stage surgeries reported. A case presentation of a 68-year-old female highlights these complexities. The final diagnosis encompassed stage I gastric cancer and stage IV colon cancer, leading to adjuvant chemotherapy. Synchronous gastric cancer and CRC present a unique clinical challenge, necessitating tailored approaches. Collaboration between surgical and oncological teams is crucial for comprehensive treatment planning and optimizing patient outcomes.",Colon_Cancer
"Advances in the understanding of biochemical and molecular processes associated with cellular growth and differentiation, as well as colonic carcinogenesis hold promise for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for this disease. Altered glycosylation of cell surface and secreted glycoconjugates appear to be useful markers in differentiating normal from malignant colonic tissue. New information regarding deletion and inappropriate expression of several blood group-related carbohydrate antigens as well as the synthesis of unique cancer-related carbohydrate structures has been derived from the use of monoclonal antibody technology, and may lead to more sensitive and specific screening tests and targeted therapies. Several glycoprotein markers for colon cancer have been studied whose diagnostic accuracy may surpass the limited sensitivity and specificity of traditional markers such as CEA. Colorectal cancers contain numerous quantitative and qualitative differences in metabolic and synthetic enzyme activities compared with normal colonic mucosa, which may be of potential importance in designing chemotherapeutic regimens or for following disease activity. Other cancer-associated markers, such as increases in orthinine decarboxylase activity and crypt cell labeling reflect abnormal proliferative activity and may be correlated with premalignant states. Studies of protooncogene expression and certain chromosomal deletions will provide insight into mechanisms of carcinogenesis and may also serve to define high-risk individuals. It is likely that as the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying malignancy are further delineated, cancer-associated markers will be defined that will improve diagnostic and more importantly, therapeutic efficacy.",Colon_Cancer
"Facial metastasis from colorectal cancer is very unusual. Herein, we report a 53-year-old man with history of colon cancer who was referred to our clinic because of an asymptomatic nodule on his chin for one year. Histopathologic examination of the nodule revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma, which was similar to that of the primary colon adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent radiotherapy for his skin metastasis, but he died 13 months later from widespread metastasis. I have no conflict of interest and no source of support.",Colon_Cancer
"Molecular imaging plays an important role in the evaluation and management of thyroid cancer. The routine use of thyroid scanning in all thyroid nodules is no longer recommended by many authorities. In the initial work-up of a thyroid nodule, radioiodine imaging can be particularly helpful when the thyroid stimulating hormone level is low and an autonomously functioning nodule is suspected. Radioiodine imaging can also be helpful in the 10-15% of cases for which fine-needle aspiration biopsy is indeterminate. Therapy of confirmed thyroid cancer frequently involves administration of iodine-131 after surgery to ablate remnant tissue. In the follow-up of thyroid cancer patients, increased thyroglobulin levels will often prompt the empiric administration of 131I followed by whole body radioiodine imaging in the search for recurrent or metastatic disease. 131I imaging of the whole body and blood pharmacokinetics can be used to determine if higher doses of 131I can be given in thyroid cancer. The utility of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is steadily increasing. FDG is primarily taken up by dedifferentiated thyroid cancer cells, which are poorly iodine avid. Thus, it is particularly helpful in the patient with an increased thyroglobulin but negative radioiodine scan. FDG PET is also useful in the patient with a neck mass but unknown primary, in patients with aggressive (dedifferentiated) thyroid cancer, and in patients with differentiated cancer where histologic transformation to dedifferentiation is suspected. In rarer types of thyroid cancer, such as medullary thyroid cancer, FDG and other tracers such as 99mTc sestamibi, [11C]methionine, [111In]octreotide, and [68Ga]somatostatin receptor binding reagents have been utilized. 124I is not widely available, but has been used for PET imaging of thyroid cancer and will likely see broader applicability due to the advantages of PET methodology.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Identifying and understanding changes in cancer genomes is essential for the development of targeted therapeutics. Here we analyse systematically more than 70 pairs of primary human colon tumours by applying next-generation sequencing to characterize their exomes, transcriptomes and copy-number alterations. We have identified 36,303 protein-altering somatic changes that include several new recurrent mutations in the Wnt pathway gene TCF7L2, chromatin-remodelling genes such as TET2 and TET3 and receptor tyrosine kinases including ERBB3. Our analysis for significantly mutated cancer genes identified 23 candidates, including the cell cycle checkpoint kinase ATM. Copy-number and RNA-seq data analysis identified amplifications and corresponding overexpression of IGF2 in a subset of colon tumours. Furthermore, using RNA-seq data we identified multiple fusion transcripts including recurrent gene fusions involving R-spondin family members RSPO2 and RSPO3 that together occur in 10% of colon tumours. The RSPO fusions were mutually exclusive with APC mutations, indicating that they probably have a role in the activation of Wnt signalling and tumorigenesis. Consistent with this we show that the RSPO fusion proteins were capable of potentiating Wnt signalling. The R-spondin gene fusions and several other gene mutations identified in this study provide new potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention in colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Evidence emerging from many different types of experimental designs continues to support the concept that dietary habits, and nutritional status, play important roles in determining the risk of developing colorectal cancer. Overall, a diet habitually high in fresh fruits and vegetables, modest in calories and alcohol, and low in red meat and animal fat is cancer protective. This field of investigation is nevertheless very confusing, particularly because longstanding hypotheses, such as the presumed protective effects of fruits, vegetables, and fiber, have recently been challenged by well-designed prospective trials. The search for individual components in the diet that convey protection continues: calcium, folate, and selenium are the leading candidates in this regard. There is also growing interest in other plant-based compounds, so-called phytochemicals, although our understanding of their effects is quite rudimentary at present. However, regardless of the constituent components of the diet, evidence continues to accrue that ingesting a sensible amount of calories and maintaining a desirable weight also play important roles in prevention of this cancer. Although the inconsistencies in this field make it tempting to minimize its import, there is little question that diet has a major impact on colorectal cancer risk; diligent attention to the rigorous conduct of studies and their interpretation will likely clarify these relationships over the next decade, much to the benefit of public health.",Colon_Cancer
"The genes that are mutated in two of the rare syndromes of hereditary colon cancer were recently identified, and genetic diagnosis is already possible in some cases. Acquired mutations of these same genes also appear to be important in sporadic colon cancers. Familial clustering of sporadic cases is common and may likewise arise from inherited susceptibility. Screening strategies for both the rare syndromes and the common cases of colon cancer with familial risk have been suggested. Certain clinical features allow stratification of colon cancer risk among common cases. It is anticipated that continued genetic investigation will result in more precise screening and improved diagnostic and therapeutic options for colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography provides an opportunity to save lives by early detection of the deadliest cancer in the United States. Uptake of lung cancer screening has been quite low but may be improving.

"Serum ferritin, one of the nonspecific tumor markers, was studied in 102 thyroid cancer patients, who had been thyroidectomized and were off thyroxine for 1 month, making them hypothyroid. Serum ferritin in thyroid cancer patients was not significantly different as compared to controls. Nevertheless, high levels of serum ferritin were observed in the thyroid cancer group as compared to primary hypothyroid patients. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in serum ferritin between thyroid cancer patients without metastasis and those with metastasis, patients with metastasis showing higher levels. Classification of thyroid cancer patients into different histological types revealed higher ferritin levels in follicular carcinoma as compared to papillary carcinoma. These data suggest that, although serum ferritin may not be a tumor marker for thyroid cancer, this parameter seems to be sensitive to the presence of metastasis and the histologic diagnosis.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Randomised controlled trials, including the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and the NELSON trial, have shown reduced mortality with lung cancer screening with low-dose CT compared with chest radiography or no screening. Although research has provided clarity on key issues of lung cancer screening, uncertainty remains about aspects that might be critical to optimise clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. This Review brings together current evidence on lung cancer screening, including an overview of clinical trials, considerations regarding the identification of individuals who benefit from lung cancer screening, management of screen-detected findings, smoking cessation interventions, cost-effectiveness, the role of artificial intelligence and biomarkers, and current challenges, solutions, and opportunities surrounding the implementation of lung cancer screening programmes from an international perspective. Further research into risk models for patient selection, personalised screening intervals, novel biomarkers, integrated cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assessments, smoking cessation interventions, and artificial intelligence for lung nodule detection and risk stratification are key opportunities to increase the efficiency of lung cancer screening and ensure equity of access.",Lung_Cancer

"Papers in the review period have investigated the reasons why radiologists frequently overlook early lung cancers and have demonstrated that the rate at which radiologists falsely categorize a solitary pulmonary nodule as benign, through the use of commercially available CT phantom densitometry is higher than was previously believed. Attempts have also been made to find CT characteristics other than density that may help to distinguish benign from malignant nodules. A number of articles have addressed methods of improving the yield and reducing the pneumothorax rate following needle biopsy of pulmonary nodules. The major role of the radiologist when evaluating patients with known or probable lung cancer is to stage the tumor.

In 1996, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) launched a worldwide TNM staging project to create international databases that would be used to continue the excellent efforts of Dr. Cliff Mountain, who pioneered this approach to lung cancer staging in 1973. Successive iterations of tumor, nodule, metastasis (TNM) staging for lung cancer have addressed shortcomings identified by the oncology community. Similarly, the IASLC recognized that it is important that further revisions continue to be made to ensure that the international staging system for lung cancer remains fit for its purpose. The last work of the International Staging Committee (ISC) was the conduct of the study that informed the seventh edition of the international staging system for lung cancer, in 2010. This review of image and staging in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), includes a summary of the different noninvasive tests currently available for staging non small cell lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer
"The incidence of recurrence after curative resection in colon cancer is approximately 20%, and liver metastasis is the most common. Diagnostic modalities including recent techniques for recurrent colon cancer for example also in the liver, are not complete to point out minimal lesions. Thus, it is very hard to evaluate that recurrent lesions are localized or not. On the other hand, only regional treatments such as surgical resection and hepatic infusion chemotherapy are effective for this cancer, and the effect of systemic chemotherapy including 5-FU-LV and new agents are still now limited. From these points of view, for better management of patients with recurrent colon cancer, deeply understandings of incompleteness of imaging diagnoses and well application of local treatments are required.",Colon_Cancer
"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in men and the second leading cause in women. Smoking cessation is the most effective measure to prevent development of lung cancer. Early detection trials with chest x-ray and sputum cytology failed to show reduction lung cancer mortality, despite the larger proportion of early-stage lung cancer diagnosed in the screened arm. The advent of low-dose chest computed tomography disclosed new perspectives. In 2011 an innovative, large prospective randomized controlled trial called ""Reduced lung-cancer mortality with low-dose computed tomographic screening"" was published and revealed reduced lung-cancer and overall mortality when persons at risk were annually screened by low-dose computed tomography compared to annually chest x-rays. At the moment, lung cancer screening cannot be recommended in general. It is uncertain for which duration screening should be continued, which screening modality is most appropriate and cost effective and what the psychological impact in case of indeterminate findings is. To avoid lung cancer screening programs being started imprudently, the Swiss healthcare system needs a provider independent commission mandated to continuously monitor ongoing screening trials, evaluate the results as well as the economical aspects, and make evidence based recommendations.",Lung_Cancer
"Although various benign and malignant tumors can occur in the bronchi and lungs, lung cancer is by far the most common tumor and the leading cause of tumor death worldwide. For therapeutic reasons lung cancer is classified currently as small cell (SCLC) or non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The main cause is smoking. There are no specific symptoms that enable early detection. Staging is according to the international TNM-system. As the results of therapy to date are disappointing and many questions remain unsolved, as many patients as possible should be included in further prospective trials. In SCLC polychemotherapy is mandatory; in local tumor stages radiotherapy should be combined early on with chemotherapy, and in cases of complete remission, prophylactic cranial irradiation is indicated. In operable stages of NSCLC adjuvant chemotherapy demonstrates a survival benefit. In locally advanced NSCLC, radiochemotherapy is now the standard of care. Advanced stages require chemotherapy usually with two drugs, second-line chemotherapy is indicated in cases of relapse.",Lung_Cancer

"The heterogeneity of colon cancers and their reactions presents both a challenge and promise for personalized medicine. The challenge is to develop effective biologically personalized therapeutics guided by predictive and prognostic biomarkers. Presently, there are several classes of candidate biomarkers, including genomic probes, inhibitory RNAs, assays for immunity dysfunction and, not to be forgotten, specific histopathologic and histochemical features. To develop effective therapeutics, candidate biomarkers must be qualified and validated in comparable independent cohorts, no small undertaking. This process and subsequent deployment in clinical practice involves not only the strong association of the biomarker with the treatment but also careful attention to the prosaic aspects of representative tumor site selection, obtaining a fully adequate sample which is preserved and prepared to optimize high quality analysis. In the future, the clinical utility of biomarker analytical results will benefit from associated clinical and basic science data with the assistance of artificial intelligence techniques. By application of an individualized, selected suite of biomarkers, comprehensively interpreted, individualized, more effective and less toxic therapy for colon cancer will be enabled, thereby fulfilling the promise of personalized medicine.",Colon_Cancer
"The rapid development of synchrotrons has massively increased the speed at which experiments can be performed, while new techniques have increased the amount of raw data collected during each experiment. While this has created enormous new opportunities, it has also created tremendous challenges for national facilities and users. With the huge increase in data volume, the manual analysis of data is no longer possible. As a result, only a fraction of the data collected during the time- and money-expensive synchrotron beam-time is analyzed and used to deliver new science. Additionally, the lack of an appropriate data analysis environment limits the realization of experiments that generate a large amount of data in a very short period of time. The current lack of automated data analysis pipelines prevents the fine-tuning of beam-time experiments, further reducing their potential usage. These effects, collectively known as the ""data deluge,"" affect synchrotrons in several different ways including fast data collection, available local storage, data management systems, and curation of the data. This review highlights the Big Data strategies adopted nowadays at synchrotrons, documenting this novel and promising hybridization between science and technology, which promise a dramatic increase in the number of scientific discoveries.",Generic
"Progress in understanding the molecular genetics of thyroid cancer in the last 20 years has accelerated recently with the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies known as Next-Generation Sequencing. Besides classical molecular abnormalities involving the MAPK (Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase) and PI3K (PhosphoInositide 3-Kinase) pathways that play a key role in follicular-derived thyroid tumorigenesis, new molecular abnormalities have been discovered. The major advances in recent years have been the discovery of new somatic driver gene point mutations (such as RASAL1 [RAS protein activator Like 1] mutations in follicular cancer) and/or mutations that have prognostic value (such as TERT [Telomerase reverse transcriptase] promoter mutations); new chromosomal rearrangements, usually having close connection with exposure to ionizing radiation (such as ALK [Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase] rearrangements); and deregulation of some gene or microRNA expression representing a molecular signature.

"Thyroglobulin (Tg) is a large molecule containing 2750 amino acids with a molecular weight of 330 kD and twenty putative N-linked glycosylation sites. Tg gene expression is regulated by thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) and human paired box 8 (Pax-8). Iodinated Tg is stored in the lumen of the thyroid follicles and is released in response to specific hormonal stimulation by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Following Tg reabsorption by thyrocytes and subsequent degradation, thyroid hormones triiodothryronine (T(3)) and thyroxine (T(4)) are secreted in the bloodstream. Mutations within the Tg gene cause defective thyroid hormone synthesis, resulting in congenital hypothyroidism. Thyroid carcinoma may develop from dyshormonogenic goiters due to Tg mutation. Post-thyroidectomy Tg levels are apparently associated with prognosis of papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas and may predict tumor recurrence and metastastic potential. The detection of Tg by biochemical and molecular means has important diagnostic significance due to its pleiotropic roles in identification of tissue of thyroid origin, differentiation, and post-operative follow-up.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Differentiated thyroid cancer, which includes papillary and follicular histologies, is a common malignancy and is increasing in incidence. It carries a favorable prognosis compared to other cancers. However, optimal outcomes are achieved only via coordinated multimodal therapy. Of these treatments, surgery is the cornerstone of initial management. Most patients should undergo thyroidectomy with concomitant central neck (level VI) lymph node dissection. On the other hand, thyroidectomy alone may be appropriate for patients with smaller tumors (T1 or T2) and no evidence of suspicious lymphadenopathy. Surgery is also indicated in cases of cervical lymph node metastases and locoregional recurrence. The principal adjuvant therapy is radioactive iodine, which should be considered in patients with a high risk of locoregional recurrence or with metastatic disease. Similarly, suppression of endogenous thyroid-stimulating hormone is recommended in patients with an elevated risk of recurrence. External-beam radiotherapy is indicated in patients with gross extrathyroidal extension or residual disease not amenable to surgery. Finally, molecular therapies, especially those targeting key tyrosine kinases and/or inhibiting angiogenesis, are emerging treatment modalities that could replace the limited efficacy of conventional chemotherapy.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Thyroid cancer is a rare malignancy with wide interethnic and geographic variations. In Germany thyroid carcinoma is the 13th most frequent malignancy (2.7 new cases yearly per 100,000 inhabitants). The overall temporal incidence is increasing slightly in recent years. The most common types of cancer are papillary (60-80%) and follicular cancers (10-20%). The relevant prognostic indicators are tumor stage and distant metastases. The mean survival rates in papillary thyroid cancer usually exceed 90%, whereas in follicular thyroid cancer they amount to approximately 80%. The standard treatment procedure in differentiated papillary and follicular thyroid cancer consists of total thyroidectomy followed by adjuvant ablative therapy with radioiodine. Only in papillary thyroid cancer stage pT1N0M0 lobectomy alone is considered to be appropriate. In patients with locally invasive differentiated thyroid cancers stage pT4 adjuvant percutaneous radiation therapy is a treatment option. Radioiodine therapy has to be performed under the stimulative influence of TSH. Usually TSH suppressive medication with Levothyroxine has to be withdrawn approximately 4 weeks prior to radioiodine therapy. In the future, exogenous stimulation by recombinant TSH may be used instead of thyroid hormone withdrawal. It has been proven by different studies that ablative radioiodine therapy reduces the frequency of recurrences and tumor spread in patients with thyroid cancer significantly. In patients with distant metastases, up to 50% of complete responses may be achieved with radioiodine treatment.",Thyroid_Cancer

This scheme has been adopted to classify 1339 consecutive cases of thyroid carcinoma observed at the Pathology Institute of the University of Florence between June 1966 and December 1993. The clinical implications of newer classification systems with regard to diagnosis, treatment and outcome of thyroid carcinoma are also discussed.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Despite extensive clinical trials, mortality from colon cancer has remained essentially unchanged since the 1950s. However, the increasing numbers of complete and partial responses seen in clinical trials suggest that colon cancer can be successfully treated by chemotherapy, but only if the antitumour selectivity can be increased by a substantial amount. This will be possible by the introduction of new drugs with more precise mechanisms of action, such as those acting specifically on signalling or cell cycle control pathways shown to be aberrant in colon cancer. Alternatively, the selectivity of present day agents may be increased considerably by the selective activation of prodrugs in tumours (ADEPT) or by targeting them to tumours using polymers. Other new approaches using vaccines or some form of gene therapy will potentiate present chemotherapy, while the introduction of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning will allow the rapid detection of agents with activity that would have been missed by conventional measurements of response.",Colon_Cancer
"Only patients with localized lung cancer benefit from curative resection. Curative radiotherapy is recommended in patients with a resectable tumor in whom surgery is precluded for medical reasons. Adjuvant preoperative or postoperative therapy of any type does not improve the results of surgery except in patients with Pancoast tumor. Therapy for nonlocalized tumors does not affect survival. Radiotherapy has a palliative effect in 50 to 75 per cent of patients presenting with symptoms from either a primary lesion or metastases and should therefore be recommended in symptomatic patients. The palliative effect of chemotherapy is limited in lung cancers other than small cell carcinomas. However, chemotherapy alone or in association with radiotherapy produces remarkable tumor regression and some improvement of survival in small cell carcinoma. The use of immunotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer is still under evaluation.",Lung_Cancer

"Advances in the understanding of the biology of lung cancer have progressed rapidly over the past decade while treatment results have remained essentially unchanged. It is clear that the knowledge of the heterogeneity of lung cancer cell types in respect of growth properties, biomarker expression, oncogene expression, and antigen expression needs to be applied in the clinic; and their role in predicting response to cytotoxic therapy and survival needs prospective evaluation. In addition the application of cell lines in screening for tumor-specific cytotoxic agents should provide for a more rational approach for drug selection in future clinical trials. Finally the development of magnetic resonance spectroscopy may also play a role both in further understanding the biology of lung cancer, and in the clinical assessment of tumor sensitivity in vivo. More recent data using DNA probes specific for the cytogenetic deletion on chromosome 3, previously identified in only SCLC, suggests that this deletion 3p 14-23 is common to most, if not all, cell types of lung cancer. This adds further to the hypothesis that a common stem cell exists from which all histologic types of lung cancer arise.",Lung_Cancer
"Colon cancer is a major problem in Western countries and complete surgical resection is the main treatment. Since its introduction the laparoscopic approach has been used to achieve bowel resection with a better postoperative course and better aesthetic outcomes. Initial concerns about the radicality of the resection and the oncologic outcomes have been overcome in the last decade. All over the world large trials have been conducted to compare the laparoscopic approach and the traditional laparotomic one. A review of literature has been conducted to find evidence about this issue, revealing 24 relevant trials. The laparoscopic approach showed short-term benefits without compromising oncological safety. However intraoperative complication rates during laparoscopic colon resections seem to be increased, mainly due to the increased rate of intraoperative bowel injury. This finding confirms a great need for training and a wide learning curve for the surgeon. Our review supports the continued use of laparoscopic surgery in patients with colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Lung cancer is a devastating disease and a major therapeutic burden with poor survival rates. It is responsible for 30% of all cancer deaths. Lung cancer is strongly associated with smoking, although some subtypes are also seen in non-smokers. Tumors in the latter group are mostly adenocarcinomas with many carrying mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Survival statistics of lung cancer are grim because of its late detection and frequent local and distal metastases. Although DNA sequence information from tumors has revealed a number of frequently occurring mutations, affecting well-known tumor suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes, many of the driver mutations remain ill defined. This is likely due to the involvement of numerous rather infrequently occurring driver mutations that are difficult to distinguish from the very large number of passenger mutations detected in smoking-related lung cancers. Therefore, experimental model systems are indispensable to validate putative driver lesions and to gain insight into their mechanisms of action. Whereas a large fraction of these analyzes can be performed in cell cultures in vitro, in many cases the consequences of the mutations have to be assessed in the context of an intact organism, as this is the context in which the Mendelian selection process of the tumorigenic process took place and the advantages of particular mutations become apparent. Current mouse models for cancer are very suitable for this as they permit mimicking many of the salient features of human tumors. The capacity to swiftly re-engineer complex sets of lesions found in human tumors in mice enables us to assess the contribution of defined combinations of lesions to distinct tumor characteristics such as metastatic behavior and response to therapy. In this review we will describe mouse models of lung cancer and how they are used to better understand the disease and how they are exploited to develop better intervention strategies.",Lung_Cancer

"The limited efficacy of conventional treatments in progressive thyroid carcinomas indicates the need for new therapeutic options. Activating mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase-encoding RET gene have been identified as driving oncogenic events in subsets of papillary (PTC) and medullary (MTC) thyroid carcinomas suggesting the interest of targeted therapy. The role of RET oncogenes and the encoded constitutively active oncoproteins as potential targets has been investigated by different strategies including gene therapy and pharmacological approaches, but targeted treatment for RET-driven cancers is not clinically available in current therapy. Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including sorafenib, sunitinib, motesanib and vandetanib, which have already shown efficacy against other neoplastic diseases, are being evaluated in clinical trials for treatment of thyroid carcinomas. Most of them, also described as Ret inhibitors, are multi-kinase inhibitors with antiangiogenic activity related to inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors. Preclinical evidence supports the relevance of Ret oncoproteins as therapeutic targets for a subset of thyroid neoplastic diseases and, although targeting the original causal genetic change may not be sufficient to control the disease efficiently, the available knowledge outlines therapeutic opportunities for exploiting Ret inhibition.",Thyroid_Cancer

"The Contribution of Occupational Exposures to Lung Cancer. The overall importance of occupational agents as a cause of lung cancer has been a controversial subject since the 1970s. A federal report, released in the late 1970s, projected a surprisingly high burden of occupational lung cancer; for asbestos and four other agents, from 61,000 to 98,000 cases annually were attributed to these agents alone. Many estimates followed, some much more conservative. For example, Doll and Peto estimated that 15% of lung cancer in men and 5% in women could be attributed to occupational exposures. A number of population-based case-control studies also provide relevant estimates. In a recent literature review, Vineis and Simonato cited attributable risk estimates for occupation and lung cancer that ranged from 4% to 40%; for asbestos alone, the estimates ranged from 1% to 5%. These estimates would be expected to vary across locations and over time. Nevertheless, these recent estimates indicate that occupation remains an important cause of lung cancer. Approaches to Prevention. Prevention of lung cancer mortality among workers exposed to agents or industrial processes that cause lung cancer may involve several strategies, including eliminating or reducing exposures, smoking cessation, screening, and chemo-prevention. For example, changes in industrial processes that have eliminated or reduced exposures to chloromethyl ethers and nickel compounds have provided evidence of reduced risk of lung cancer following these changes. Although occupational exposures are important causes of lung cancer, cigarette smoking is the most important preventable cause of lung cancer. For adults, the work site offers an important location to target smoking cessation efforts. In fact, the work site may be the only place to reach many smokers. As many as 70% of smokers participating in a work site program reported that they would not seek out other programs for smoking cessation. Furthermore, these programs may be as effective as other smoking cessation programs, with abstinence approaching 30%. By creating a supportive social environment, policies restricting smoking in the workplace may also assist smokers trying to quit. Screening of workers at high risk of lung cancer, with periodic chest radiography and sputum cytology, offers potential methods for early detection that may improve prognosis. However, the failure of those procedures to improve outcome from lung cancer among high-risk smokers makes screening of workers of doubtful value. Both epidemiologic and experimental evidence suggest that dietary factors may modify the risk of lung cancer. To date, attention has been focused on vitamin A and carotenoids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Lung_Cancer
"Anaplastic thyroid cancers represent 1-2% of all thyroid tumours and are of very poor prognosis even with multimodality treatment including external beam radiation therapy. Conversely, differentiated thyroid carcinomas (at least 80% of thyroid cancers) hamper good prognosis with surgery with or without radioiodine and there is hardly any room for external beam radiation therapy. Insular and medullar carcinomas have intermediary prognosis and are rarely irradiated. We aimed to update recommendations for external beam irradiation in these different clinical situations and put in light the benefits of new irradiations techniques. A search of the French and English literature was performed using the following keywords: thyroid carcinoma, anaplastic, chemoradiation, radiation therapy, surgery, histology and prognostic. Non-mutilating surgery (often limited to debulking) followed by systematic external beam radiation therapy is the standard of care in anaplastic thyroid cancers (hyperfractionated-accelerated radiation therapy with low-dose weekly doxorubicin with or without cisplatin if possible). Given anaplastic thyroid cancers' median survival of 10 months or less, neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy may also be discussed. Ten-year survival rates for patients with papillary, follicular and H rthle-cell carcinomas are 93%, 85%, and 76%, respectively. Massive primary incompletely resected iodine-negative disease indicates external beam radiation therapy. Older age (45 or 60-year-old), poor-prognosis histological variants (including tall cell cancers) and insular cancers are increasingly reported as criteria for external beam radiation therapy. Massive extracapsular incompletely resected nodal medullary disease suggests external beam radiation therapy. Radiation therapy morbidity has been an important limitation. However, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) offers clear dosimetric advantages on tumour coverage and organ sparing, reducing late toxicities to less than 5%. The role of radiation therapy is evolving for anaplastic thyroid cancers using multimodal strategies and new chemotherapy molecules, and for differentiated cancers using minor criteria, such as histological variants, with IMRT becoming a standard of care.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in adults of age 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and are currently smoking or have quit within the past 15 years. This recommendation is largely based on the findings of the National Lung Screening Trial. Both policy-level and clinical decision-making about LDCT screening must consider the potential benefits of screening (reduced mortality from lung cancer) and possible harms. Effective screening requires an appreciation that screening should be limited to individuals at high risk of death from lung cancer, and that the risk of harm related to false positive findings, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary invasive testing is real. A comprehensive understanding of these aspects of screening will inform appropriate implementation, with the objective that an evidence-based and systematic approach to screening will help to reduce the enormous mortality burden of lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer
"Telomere and telomerase regulation contributes to the onset and evolution of several tumors, including highly aggressive thyroid cancers (TCs). TCs are the most common endocrine malignancies and are generally characterized by a high rate of curability. However, a small but significant percentage develops distant metastasis or progresses into undifferentiated forms associated with bad prognosis and for which poor therapeutic options are available. Mutations in telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter are among the most credited prognostic marker of aggressiveness in TCs. Indeed, their frequency progressively increases passing from indolent lesions to aggressive and anaplastic forms. TERT promoter mutations create binding sites for transcription factors, increasing TERT expression and telomerase activity. Furthermore, aggressiveness of TCs is associated with TERT locus amplification. These data encourage investigating telomerase regulating pathways as relevant drivers of TC development and progression to foster the identification of new therapeutics targets. Here, we summarize the current knowledge about telomere regulation and TCs, exploring both canonical and less conventional pathways. We discuss the possible role of telomere homeostasis in mediating response to cancer therapies and the possibility of using epigenetic drugs to re-evaluate the use of telomerase inhibitors. Combined treatments could be of support to currently used therapies still presenting weaknesses.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Within the context of the latest resurgence in the application of artificial intelligence approaches, deep learning has undergone a renaissance over recent years. These methods have been applied to a number of problems in computational chemistry. Compared to other machine learning approaches, the practical performance advantages of deep neural networks are often unclear. However, deep learning does appear to offer a number of other advantages such as the facile incorporation of multitask learning and the enhancement of generative modeling. The high complexity of contemporary network architectures represents a potentially significant barrier to their future adoption due to the costs of training such models and challenges in interpreting their predictions.

"Twenty-nine patients with advanced thyroid cancer have been treated with sequential chemotherapy regimes using the single agents etoposide, carboplatin, cis-platinum or methotrexate, and the combination of adriamycin, bleomycin and vincristine (ABC). Indications for chemotherapy were progressive, symptomatic recurrent or metastatic disease unresponsive to conventional treatment, or advanced anaplastic carcinomas. In these 29 patients there were a total of 60 evaluable drug exposures: 4 out of 22 responded to etoposide, 2 out of 9 responded to carboplatin, 5 out of 13 responded to cis-platinum, 1 out of 3 responded to methotrexate and 5 out of 13 responded to ABC. There was only one complete response in this series, seen with etoposide. Patients under 65 years and those with medullary carcinoma had the highest response rates. Mean survival in these 29 patients was 11.9 months. Mean survival in responders was 19 months compared to 5.4 months in non-responders. Etoposide, carboplatin and cis-platinum used as single agents are active in thyroid carcinoma and useful symptom control and improved survival may be achieved in those patients responding to sequential exposure to these agents.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Comparison of serum cholesterol levels in a matched case-control study indicates that patients with colon cancer have serum cholesterol levels lower than those of controls. In 133 pairs matched by age and sex, serum cholesterol levels were 188 +/- 42 mg/dl for cases and 213 +/- 42 mg/dl for controls (paired t-test = 5.08; P less than 0.001). Following stratification by tumor stage, significant differences in serum cholesterol levels persisted between cases with advanced tumors (Duke's classification C1, C2, and D) and controls (mean serum cholesterol difference, 41 +/- 41 mg/dl; paired t-test = 6.16; P less than 0.001) but not between cases with early tumors (Duke's classification A, B1, and B2) and controls, although the same trend was noted. Matching of 130 early tumors to advanced tumors showed that women, but not men, had a significantly lower serum cholesterol level with advancing disease. The findings support the concept that low serum cholesterol levels observed in colon cancer patients may be the result of the metabolic influence of advanced tumors, at least in women, and may not necessarily precede tumor formation.",Colon_Cancer
"Laparoscopic-assisted colectomy (LAC) for colon cancer was first described in 1991. Unlike other laparoscopic procedures used to treat benign disease, the LAC for colon cancer has been slow to gain acceptance for a variety of reasons. Recently, several large, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that LACs are comparable with open colectomies with respect to oncological issues such as survival, port-site metastases and tumor recurrence. Moreover, there are significant patient benefits with the use of LAC including duration of analgesic use, return of bowel function, length of stay and return to normal activity.",Colon_Cancer
"The innovation of biotechnologies has allowed the accumulation of omics data at an alarming rate, thus introducing the era of 'big data'. Extracting inherent valuable knowledge from various omics data remains a daunting problem in bioinformatics. Better solutions often need some kind of more innovative methods for efficient handlings and effective results. Recent advancements in integrated analysis and computational modeling of multi-omics data helped address such needs in an increasingly harmonious manner. The development and application of machine learning have largely advanced our insights into biology and biomedicine and greatly promoted the development of therapeutic strategies, especially for precision medicine. Here, we propose a comprehensive survey and discussion on what happened, is happening and will happen when machine learning meets omics. Specifically, we describe how artificial intelligence can be applied to omics studies and review recent advancements at the interface between machine learning and the ever-widest range of omics including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, radiomics, as well as those at the single-cell resolution. We also discuss and provide a synthesis of ideas, new insights, current challenges and perspectives of machine learning in omics.",Generic
"Development of novel metallodrugs with pharmacological profile plays a significant role in modern medicinal chemistry and drug design. Metal complexes have shown remarkable clinical results in current cancer therapy. Gold complexes have attained attention due to their high antiproliferative potential. Gold-based drugs are used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Gold-containing compounds with selective and specific targets are capable to assuage the symptoms of a range of human diseases. Gold (I) species with labile ligands (such as Cl in TEPAuCl) interact with isolated DNA; therefore, this biomolecule has been considered as a target for gold drugs. Gold (I) has a high affinity towards sulfur and selenium. Due to this, gold (I) drugs readily interact with cysteine or selenocysteine residue of the enzyme to form protein-gold(I) thiolate or protein-gold (I) selenolate complexes that lead to inhibition of the enzyme activity. Au(III) compounds due to their square-planner geometriesthe same as found in cisplatin, represent a good source for the development of anti-tumor agents. This article aims to review the most important applications of gold products in the treatment of human colon cancer and to analyze the complex interplay between gold and the human body.",Colon_Cancer
"Metallothioneins (MTs) are low weight proteins involved in several key cellular processes such as metal ions homeostasis, detoxification and scavenging of free radicals. Four groups of MTs are distinguished: MT-1, MT-2, MT-3 and MT-4. Regardless of the type, MTs are characterized by high content of cysteine, responsible for their biological properties such as binding of relevant zinc and copper ions, as well as toxic ions such as lead and cadmium. MTs were additionally shown to protect cells against oxidative stress damage and participate in differentiation, proliferation and/or apoptosis of normal and cancer cells. Many studies of different neoplasms showed association of elevated MTs levels with occurrence of chemo- and radiotherapy resistance and poor patients' outcome. In this review, we summarize and discuss the potential mechanism of action of metallotioneins in lung physiology and pathology.",Lung_Cancer
"The effects of chemotherapy for lung metastasis in 284 cancer patients using various anti-tumor drugs, including classic ones and modern active agents for the past 18 years, were presented. Lung metastasis for lung cancer was excluded. The response was achieved in cervical carcinoma of the uterus (17/62, 27%), endometrial carcinoma of the uterus (1/7, 14%), colorectal cancer (6/39, 15%), breast cancer (5/28, 18%) and stomach cancer (4/28, 14%). A high response was achieved in myosarcoma (5/12, 42%), testicular cancer (5/11, 45%) and also in ovarian cancer (3/10, 30%). Though there were few cases, a high response was achieved in malignant melanoma (2/3), choriocarcinoma (2/4) and esophageal cancer (1/3). In total patients the response rate was 20%. In these cases a complete response was achieved in 4 cervical cancers; one testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, esophageal cancer and renal cancer, respectively. However, the effect was temporary and no longterm survivor was observed except for one case of renal cancer treated continuously with interferon (3 X 10(6) units daily) and showing complete remission after 7 months of therapy. The effect of chemotherapy for lung metastasis was compared between nodular metastasis (NM) and lymphagiosis carcinomatosa (LC). In cervical carcinoma of the uterus, the response rate in NM (39%) was higher than in LC (11%). However, no difference was observed in breast cancer (NM 15%, LC 13%) nor in stomach cancer (NM 13%, LC 18%).",Lung_Cancer

The risk factors, the existence of a preclinical phase, and the relationship between stage at diagnosis and survival are known. A number of strategies that aim to diagnose lung cancer in its earliest stages, based principally on imaging studies, are therefore being tested. Several drugs aimed at reducing the probability of developing lung cancer in the at-risk population are also under study.

"Colon cancer is an important cause of cancer-related mortality. A series of clinical trials of adjuvant systemic therapy have been performed in attempt to establish means to improve outcome in this disease. By the early 1990s, a role for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer had been firmly established. The precise role for chemotherapy in stage II disease remains under investigation. Progress continues toward optimizing the schedule and duration of systemic therapy, allowing for maximal efficacy with a minimum of toxicity. It appears that approximately 6 months of 5-FU and leucovorin are as effective as more prolonged regimens. Levamisole does not appear to add to the benefit of 5-FU and leucovorin. Several newer agents such as the oral fluorinated pyrimidines, irinotecan (CPT-11) and oxaliplatin have demonstrated activity in metastatic colon cancer and hold promise as potentially effective drugs to be tested in the adjuvant setting.",Colon_Cancer
"A small abut important subset of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer will die of disease. Our approach to therapy treats almost all patients similarly, with aggressive surgery and I-131 therapy. Meticulous follow-up should include multiple I-131 diagnostic scans using at least 5 to 10 mCi of I-131 with attention to proper patient preparation and good quality procedures. Thyroglobulin levels should be monitored, and other radiographic diagnostic procedures, including thallium scans and MR imaging, should be used as needed. Until screening tests are discovered which will accurately pinpoint patients at high risk for aggressive, recurrent thyroid cancer, the best course of action appears to be aggressive management, including radioiodine therapy.",Thyroid_Cancer
"A population-based case-control study was carried out to follow up observations of increased lung cancer risk in the steel pouring areas of two Ontario steel mills. Study subjects were all men, aged 45-75 years, who died of lung cancer in the cities of Hamilton or Sault Ste-Marie, Ontario from 1979-1988. Nine hundred sixty-seven lung cancer victims were matched with 2,827 control subjects who died of other causes. Work histories were provided by the employers of steelworkers. In comparison with other residents of their cities, the relative risk of death from lung cancer was 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58-1.23) for steelworkers in Sault-Ste Marie and was 1.10 (95% CI: 0.89-1.37) for steelworkers in Hamilton. In internal comparisons within the steel companies, increased lung cancer risk was observed among foundry, coke oven, and pouring pit workers. Retrospective hygiene assessment suggested that the increased risk of lung cancer among steel pourers might be related to the use of tar-based mold coating agents or to exposure to mineral fibers.",Lung_Cancer
"There have been hundreds of publications about overdiagnosis during the past decade describing concern regarding its potential for harms in lung cancer screening. However, the definition and frequency with which it occurs in screening trials remains unclear. This lack of clarity stems from its current definition which is not based on a clinical grounds but instead on an epidemiologic definition that depends on the cause of death. Thus, with the current definition an overdiagnosed cancer can only be diagnosed if the person does not die from the cancer, regardless of whether or not the cancer is aggressive or the treatment successful. Using a definition based on epidemiology rather than the clinical presentation is highly unusual. Furthermore, the frequency of overdiagnosis has also been a cause of great confusion. Prior to the results from the National Lung Screening trial (NLST), concerns were expressed that virtually all CT screen detected cancers would be overdiagnosed, yet the extended follow-up study of the National Lung Screening Trial shows that in essence there were virtually no overdiagnosis. Even more confusing is that it was previously suspected that there was a high rate of overdiagnosis when using chest radiographic screening and therefore as CT is a more sensitive imaging test and finds cancers even earlier, it would be presumed that the overdiagnosis rate for CT would be even be higher. A proposed change in the definition would focus more on the clinical manifestation of the cancer as to its aggressiveness as this can be diagnosed while the patient is alive. Using a definition that is based on clinical features, a cancer that manifests as a nonsolid nodule would be considered overdiagnosed if instead of being recognized as relatively indolent was instead thought to be an aggressive cancer. The concept of overtreatment arises if this nonaggressive cancer were treated aggressively.",Lung_Cancer

"This chapter focuses on rehabilitation robotics which can be used to augment the clinician's toolbox in order to deliver meaningful restorative therapy for an aging population, as well as on advances in orthotics to augment an individual's functional abilities beyond neurorestoration potential. The interest in rehabilitation robotics and orthotics is increasing steadily with marked growth in the last 10 years. This growth is understandable in view of the increased demand for caregivers and rehabilitation services escalating apace with the graying of the population. We provide an overview on improving function in people with a weak limb due to a neurological disorder who cannot properly control it to interact with the environment (orthotics); we then focus on tools to assist the clinician in promoting rehabilitation of an individual so that s/he can interact with the environment unassisted (rehabilitation robotics). We present a few clinical results occurring immediately poststroke as well as during the chronic phase that demonstrate superior gains for the upper extremity when employing rehabilitation robotics instead of usual care. These include the landmark VA-ROBOTICS multisite, randomized clinical study which demonstrates clinical gains for chronic stroke that go beyond usual care at no additional cost.",Generic
"The study of plant metabolism is one of the most complex tasks, mainly due to the huge amount and structural diversity of metabolites, as well as the fact that they react to changes in the environment and ultimately influence each other. Metabolic profiling is most often carried out using tools that include mass spectrometry (MS), which is one of the most powerful analytical methods. All this means that even when analyzing a single sample, we can obtain thousands of data. Data science has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of plant metabolism. This review demonstrates that machine learning, network analysis, and statistical modeling are some techniques being used to analyze large quantities of complex data that provide insights into plant development, growth, and how they interact with their environment. These findings could be key to improving crop yields, developing new forms of plant biotechnology, and understanding the relationship between plants and microbes. It is also necessary to consider the constraints that come with data science such as quality and availability of data, model complexity, and the need for deep knowledge of the subject in order to achieve reliable outcomes.",Generic

"Dietary fats are thought to be important in the etiology of colon cancer. However, the evidence linking them is inconclusive. Studies on dietary protein, cholesterol and carbohydrate and the risk of colon cancer are also inconsistent. This study examined the association between dietary intake of protein, fats, cholesterol and carbohydrates, and the risk of colon cancer. Mailed questionnaires were completed by 1731 individuals with histologically confirmed cases of colon cancer and 3097 population controls between 1994 and 1997 in seven Canadian provinces. Measurements included socio-economic status, lifestyle habits and diet. A 69-item food frequency questionnaire was used to provide data on eating habits from two years before the study. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed using unconditional logistic regression. The nutrients were categorized by quartiles based on the distributions among the controls. Intake of polyunsaturated fat, trans-fat and cholesterol were significantly associated with the risk of colon cancer; the ORs for the highest quartiles were 1.36 (95% CI, 1.02-1.80), 1.37 (95% CI, 1.10-1.71) and 1.42 (95% CI, 1.10-1.84), respectively. The association was stronger with proximal colon cancer (PCC). An increased risk was also observed with increasing intake of sucrose for both proximal and distal colon cancers; the ORs for the highest quartiles were 1.67 (95% CI, 1.22-2.29) for PCC and 1.58 (95% CI, 1.18-2.10) for distal colon cancer (DCC). An elevated risk of PCC was also found with increased lactose intake. Our findings provide evidence that a diet low in fat and sucrose could reduce the risk of various colon cancers.",Colon_Cancer
"The challenges of lung cancer radiotherapy are intra/inter-fraction tumor/organ anatomy/motion changes and the need to spare surrounding critical structures. Evolving radiotherapy technologies, such as four-dimensional (4D) image-based motion management, daily on-board imaging and adaptive radiotherapy based on volumetric images over the course of radiotherapy, have enabled us to deliver higher dose to target while minimizing normal tissue toxicities. The image-guided radiotherapy adapted to changes of motion and anatomy has made the radiotherapy more precise and allowed ablative dose delivered to the target using novel treatment approaches such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy, stereotactic body radiation therapy, and proton therapy in lung cancer, techniques used to be considered very sensitive to motion change. Future clinical trials using real time tracking and biological adaptive radiotherapy based on functional images are proposed.",Lung_Cancer
"There has been a long debate about the optimal surgical management of differentiated thyroid cancer. It has focused on the extent of thyroidectomy, with recommendations ranging from thyroid lobectomy to total thyroidectomy. There is no randomized prospective trial addressing this issue; such a trial would be prohibitive, since differentiated thyroid cancer has a good prognosis and a long natural history. Instead, there is heavy reliance on retrospective analyses, as well as consensus expert opinion and experience. We review this evidence, along with recent recommendations from several professional associations. We believe that total or near-total thyroidectomy followed by (131)I ablation and thyroid hormone suppression are most appropriate for the majority of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, as retrospective analyses have shown that they reduce the risk of cancer recurrence, address the chance of multifocal intrathyroidal cancer, and facilitate use of surveillance scans and thyroglobulin monitoring for post-operative recurrence. This recommendation comes with the caveat that total thyroidectomy must be performed safely, since there is evidence that surgeon volume is associated with patient outcomes.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Various roles have been attributed to Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in cancer. Evidence exists for a pro-apoptotic function, consistent with a protective role of AChE. Because other reports suggested that upregulated AChE in some tumors may control cell adhesion, we tested the effects of AChE on anchorage independence (an essential component of metastasis) of colon tumor cells. Several AChE inhibitors dose-dependently suppressed colony formation of HTB-38 cells in soft agar. This effect of AChE was confirmed with HTB-38 cells stably overexpressing AChE. In contrast, cell proliferation was not altered by the effective doses of these chemical inhibitors or by transfected AChE. Protection from cell cycle arrest consecutive to cancer cell detachment may be conveyed by changes in cell-matrix interactions. Reflective of such changes, the AChE overexpressing cells adhered more strongly to Fibronectin than did the vector controls. The AChE-dependent adhesion was RGD-dependent and accompanied by increased c-Myb DNA-binding, suggesting that AChE upregulates an Integrin receptor via c-Myb. In support of these observations, we find AChE message and protein to be expressed in a large fraction of colon cancers and in all colon tumor cell lines analyzed, but only rarely in normal colon specimens. Our results imply a dual role for AChE in colon cancer. While the anti-apoptotic effects of AChE may be protective against early stages of tumorigenesis, this gene product may support the later stages of transformation by enhancing anchorage independent growth. The induction of Integrins could render the cells independent of microenvironmental cues and override cell cycle arrest after deadhesion.",Colon_Cancer
"Metabolic reprogramming is a vital factor in the development of many types of cancer, including colon cancer. Serine metabolic reprogramming is a major feature of tumor metabolism. Yes-associated protein (YAP) participates in organ size control and tumorigenesis. However, the relationship between YAP and serine metabolism in colon cancer is unclear. In this study, RNA sequencing and metabolomics analyses indicated significant enrichment of the glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism pathways in serine starvation-resistant cells. Short-term serine deficiency inhibited YAP activation, whereas a prolonged response dephosphorylated YAP and promoted its activity. Mechanistically, USP7 increases YAP stability under increased serine conditions by regulating deubiquitination. Verteporfin (VP) effectively inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer cells and organoids and could even modulate serine metabolism by inhibiting USP7 expression. Clinically, YAP was significantly activated in colon tumor tissues and positively correlated with the expression of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and USP7. Generally, our study uncovered the mechanism by which serine metabolism regulates YAP via USP7 and identified the crucial role of YAP in the regulation of cell proliferation and tumor growth; thus, VP may be a new treatment for colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"The presence of the neural cell adhesion molecule, NCAM, is indicative for a poor prognosis in lung-cancer patients. Using MAb 735, we have investigated the expression of polysialic acid, PSA, on NCAM in a spectrum of neuro-endocrine lung tumors, ranging from the slowly growing typical carcinoids via the atypical carcinoids with clinically unpredictable behavior to the highly aggressive small-cell lung carcinomas. Our immunohistochemical findings indicate a significant association between the presence of PSA on the tumor cells and an aggressive and immature sub-type of the tumor. This might be related to impairment of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions by the presence of PSA, as we demonstrated in vitro, since detachment is one of the first steps in the metastatic process. The NCAM-MAb 123C3 used in these studies appeared extremely useful in immunoscintigraphy and immunotherapy of SCLC xenografts in nude mice, and for immunoscintigraphy of a SCLC patient. This may be explained by internalization of the 123C3 antibody, which we demonstrated in vitro. 123C3 is the only Cluster-I SCLC MAb studied thus far that becomes internalized.",Lung_Cancer

"Worldwide, neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract have a very high incidence and mortality. Among these, colorectal cancer, which includes colon and rectum malignancies, representing both highest incidence and mortality. While gallbladder cancer, another neoplasm associated to gastrointestinal tract occurs less frequently. Genetic factors, inflammation and nutrition are important risk factors associated with colorectal cancer development. Likewise, pathogenic microorganisms inducing intestinal dysbiosis have become an important scope to determine the role of bacterial infection on tumorigenesis. Interestingly, in human biopsies of different types of gastrointestinal tract cancer, the presence of different bacterial strains, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis and Salmonella enterica have been detected, and it has been considered as a high-risk factor to cancer development. Therefore, pathogens infection could contribute to neoplastic development through different mechanisms; including intestinal dysbiosis, inflammation, evasion of tumoral immune response and activation of pro-tumoral signaling pathways, such as catenin. Here, we have reviewed the suggested bacterial molecular mechanisms and their possible role on development and progression of gastrointestinal neoplasms, focusing mainly on colon neoplasms, where the bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis and Salmonella enterica infect.",Colon_Cancer

"Colorectal cancer that occurs during an interval between screening colonoscopies is called ""interval carcinoma"". These cancers are more frequent than would be expected, diagnosed in about tow per thousand patient years.

Knowing these etiologies screening makes it possible to optimize treatment. Colonoscopy of the highest quality is essential for providing reliable screening. Risk stratification during the first colonoscopy allows for optimal timing of follow-up-examinations. Difficult polypectomies require frequent follow-ups. Serrated adenomas should be treated like adenomas. Interval carcinomas are often detected during screening at an early stage: colonoscopy screening can save life of these patients.",Colon_Cancer

"Brachytherapy (BT) is a minimally invasive anticancer radiotherapeutic modality where the tumor is directly irradiated via a radioactive source that is precisely implanted in or adjacent to the tumor. BT for lung cancer may be conducted in the form of endobronchial BT and radioactive seed implantation (RSI-BT), mainly for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For patients with early-stage lung cancer who are not suitable for surgery or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), BT may be used as an alternative treatment, and curative results could be achieved in certain patients with cancer confined to the trachea lumen. For patients with locally advanced/metastatic lung cancer, BT could be selectively applied alone or as a boost to EBRT, which could improve the local tumor control and patient's survival. In addition, BT is also useful as a salvage treatment in select patients with locally recurrent/residual lung cancer that failed other treatments (e.g., surgery, chemotherapy, and EBRT). However, clinical outcomes are mainly obtained from retrospective studies. Prospective studies are limited and needed. In recent years, the introduction of modern image guidance, novel radioactive seeds, BT treatment planning systems (BT-TPS), after-loading technique, and three-dimensional printing template (3D-PT) assistance, among others, have potentially improved the clinical outcomes of BT. However, a comprehensive review of BT with newly published literature was lacking. This review is to discuss BT for NSCLC based on recent literature published in PubMed.",Lung_Cancer
"The overall five year survival of patients with colorectal cancer is excellent compared with other major visceral malignancies. This is attributable to effect surgical treatment, yet the death rate per 100,000 population has improved little in recent decades, stimulating a search for adjuvant treatment modalities until a better understanding of etiology and pathogenesis results in prevention of earlier diagnosis. Combination of the known cancerocidal effect of ionizing radiation and surgical excision has been used sporadically for over six decades, but only recently has this combined modality therapy been studied in a scientific manner. Numerous variables such as source of radiation, total tumor dose, dose-time factors, location of portals of treatment, size and shape of radiation fields, and the radiation-surgery sequence are now being studied. Current information leaves little doubt of the effectiveness of this combined modality therapy in selected patients.

"The authors have assembled detailed family histories of cancer on 857 cancer probands, of whom 180 manifested colorectal carcinoma. This study determines if some families had a greater risk for colorectal cancer than others, and if so, what factors were associated with an increase in risk. To test for the possibility of heterogeneity of risk, a parameter called the Z-score, was calculated for each family. The Z-score is a measure of the number of cancer cases in the family adjusted for the number of expected cases. A permutation test was employed to test whether or not the variance of Z-scores from the sample was greater then expected by random chance. The variance for families ascertained through colon cancer probands, but not in any of the other groups, was significantly increased. Of the colon group, 10.6% fell into a high-risk category, as did 5.56% of the rectal cancer families, but only 3.95% of the other groups combined were at high risk. Anatomic sites (in the proband) with the highest Z-score variances were sigmoid and transverse colon, whereas lower variances were seen for cecum and descending colon. Risk status therefore may be partially dependent upon exact anatomic sites within the colon. The effect of proband's age of diagnosis was not significant, but did show the possibility of an effect on heterogeneity of risk for both the younger and older groups.",Colon_Cancer

The cells included in these multicellular spheroids (MCS) were not only altered but behave also differently to those grown in flat sheets in normal gravity, more closely mimicking the conditions in the human body. Therefore, MCS became an invaluable model for studying metastasis and developing new cancer treatment strategies via drug targeting. Microgravity intervenes deeply in processes such as apoptosis and in structural changes involving the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, which influence cell growth. Most interestingly, follicular thyroid cancer cells grown under microgravity conditions were shifted towards a less-malignant phenotype. Results from microgravity research can be used to rethink conventional cancer research and may help to pinpoint the cellular changes that cause cancer. This in turn could lead to novel therapies that will enhance the quality of life for patients or potentially develop new preventive countermeasures.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Numerous biologic processes and such diseases as cancer depend on activation of tyrosine kinase receptors. The RET tyrosine kinase receptor was discovered two decades ago as a transforming gene and was subsequently implicated in the formation of papillary and medullary thyroid carcinoma. This article examines the data about the mechanism of activation of downstream signal transduction pathways by RET oncoproteins. Collectively, these findings have advanced the understanding of the processes underlying thyroid carcinoma formation.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The epidemiology of lung cancer has changed in the last years in several countries all over the world. In the 19th century, the lung cancer was rare but it incidence increase drastically during the 20th century, and the tendency is to continue in the 20th century. Actually the lung cancer's incidence and mortality are higher in the developed countries, especially in Europe and Unites States of America, with a increasing in the women incidence. These geographic differences and gender differences are related with smoking habits. Women begin to smoke earlier and have more difficulty to stop, because of problems related with obesity; they have more sensibility to the carcinogens and the risk of lung cancer is 1.5 times higher than the men with the same habits. Adenocarcinoma is the more frequent histological type in young people, in the total of the women and in non-smokers. Many factors since tobacco, home and professional pollution, nutritional, associated diseases even genetic and hormonal factors have been investigated to define its influence in development in women lung cancer. It specificity in women with lung cancer is the common problem for the medical people to treat this disease (pathology).The literature about this problem is not clear, and is necessary to advance with many studies in this area with the objective to clarify this important question.",Lung_Cancer

This fact is important considering a non explained endocrinological and neurological syndrome, it may facilitate a prompt diagnosis, and in some cases an adequate treatment. PNS evolution seems to be parallel to the subjacent cancer. PNS management requires specific measures, because in some cases, it may compromise the patient life. Neurological and endocrinological PNS associated to lung cancer are revised, and diagnosis and treatment of them are updated.",Lung_Cancer
"One of the fields of medicine in which artificial intelligence techniques have made progress is ophthalmology. Artificial intelligence (A.I.) applications for preventing vision loss in eye illnesses have developed quickly. Artificial intelligence uses computer programs to execute various activities while mimicking human thought. Machine learning techniques are frequently utilized in the field of ophthalmology. Ophthalmology holds great promise for advancing artificial intelligence, thanks to various digital methods like optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual field testing. Artificial intelligence has been used in ophthalmology to treat eye conditions impairing vision, including macular holes (M.H.), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataracts. The more common occurrence of these diseases has led to artificial intelligence development. It is important to get annual screenings to detect eye diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration. These conditions can cause decreased visual acuity, and it is necessary to identify any changes or progression in the disease to receive appropriate treatment. Numerous studies have been conducted based on artificial intelligence using different algorithms to improve and simplify current medical practice and for early detection of eye diseases to prevent vision loss.

"Thyroid nodules are common, and the accurate diagnosis of cancer or benign disease is important for the effective clinical management of patients. Molecular markers are a helpful diagnostic tool, particularly for cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules. In the past few years, significant progress has been made in developing molecular markers for clinical use in fine-needle aspiration specimens, including gene mutation panels and gene expression classifiers. With the availability of next generation sequencing technology, gene mutation panels can be expanded to interrogate multiple genes simultaneously and to provide yet more accurate diagnostic information.

"Development and progression of many malignancies, including colorectal cancer, are associated with activation of multiple signaling pathways. Therefore, inhibition of these signaling pathways with noncytotoxic natural products represents a logical preventive and/or therapeutic approach for colon cancer. Curcumin and resveratrol, both of which inhibit the growth of transformed cells and colon carcinogenesis, were selected to examine whether combining them would be an effective preventive and/or therapeutic strategy for colon cancer. Indeed, the combination of curcumin and resveratrol was found to be more effective in inhibiting growth of p53-positive (wt) and p53-negative colon cancer HCT-116 cells in vitro and in vivo in SCID xenografts of colon cancer HCT-116 (wt) cells than either agent alone. Analysis by Calcusyn software showed synergism between curcumin and resveratrol. The inhibition of tumors in response to curcumin and/or resveratrol was associated with the reduction in proliferation and stimulation of apoptosis accompanied by attenuation of NF-kappaB activity. In vitro studies have further demonstrated that the combinatorial treatment caused a greater inhibition of constitutive activation of EGFR and its family members as well as IGF-1R. Our current data suggest that the combination of curcumin and resveratrol could be an effective preventive/therapeutic strategy for colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Colorectal cancer remains a major health problem. Few therapies are effective apart from surgery, and survival has increased little in recent years. This is despite the fact that screening by colonoscopy can potentially remove nearly all colorectal tumours before they become malignant. Molecular genetics has identified some inherited mutations (such as at APC and the mismatch repair loci) that predispose to colon cancer and some somatic mutations (such as at APC and p53) that cause sporadic colon tumours. We review the likely role of these and other genes in colorectal tumorigenesis. We also highlight areas of relative ignorance in colon cancer and emphasise that many important genes, especially those that cause invasion and metastasis, remain to be identified. Colorectal cancer is, however, a well characterised tumour, as regards both its natural history and its histopathology; there are consequently good prospects for advances in colon cancer genetics, with probable benefits for its treatment. We anticipate: (a) that new genes predisposing to colon tumours, including those conferring relatively minor risks, will be characterised; (b) genes and proteins important in invasion and metastasis will be identified; (c) the network of protein interactions in which molecules such as APC are involved will be elucidated; (d) large-scale studies of somatic mutations in tumours will provide accurate predictions of prognosis and suggest optimal therapeutic regimens; and (e) new potential targets for therapy will be identified. Whilst molecular genetics is by no means sufficient for progress in preventing and treating colon cancer, it is a necessary and central part of such advances.",Colon_Cancer
"Reoperation was performed in 110 of 185 patients with a differentiated thyroid carcinoma. In 25 patients (23 per cent) the indication for reintervention was a large thyroid remnant and in the other 85 (77 per cent) persistent or recurrent cancer was suspected. In 32 (29 per cent) of the 110 patients undergoing reoperation no evidence of cancer tissue was found. Tumour tissue in 33 patients (30 per cent) was resectable. Of 45 patients (41 per cent) with residual tumour after operation 24 showed only occult thyroid carcinoma with a raised serum thyroglobulin level. Eight of 21 patients with macroscopically persistent tumour died from the disease during a mean follow-up of 2.3 years. In 13 of 38 patients the investigated recurrent tumours were histologically less differentiated than the primary lesions, stressing the importance of total tumour clearance. The treatment of choice for persistent and recurrent differentiated thyroid carcinoma is surgical reintervention, if feasible, before radioiodine and radiation therapy are considered.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Cryosurgery is suited for patients with lung cancer who are not considered for lung resection because of the advanced stage of the disease or the patient's poor general condition or poor respiratory function and with tumor recurrence following radiotherapy, chemotherapy or lung resection, and those patients who have localized lung cancer but refuse to receive operative therapy. Procedures of cryosurgery for lung cancer can be performed through endobronchial, direct intrathoracic (at exploratory thoracotomy) or percutaneous routes depending upon location and size of tumor. Six hundred and twenty-five patients with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) received percutaneous cryoablation in Fuda Cancer Hospital Guangzhou, China. One hundred and fifty patients were followed-up for 12 to 38 months. Results showed that 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were 64%, 45% and 32%, respectively. The adverse effects after cryosurgery of lung cancer include haemoptysis, pneumothorax, bloody thorax, pleural effusion and pulmonary infection which are generally mild, transient, and recovery with symptomatic management. In vitro studies have shown cryotherapy of lung cancer cells can improve the immune system to trigger the specific anti-tumor response. In the future, comparative studies between this modality and other therapies should be conducted for the treatment of lung cancer. In addition, more attention needs to be put on the immunomodulators that enhance the cryoimmunology.",Lung_Cancer

Various epidemiologic studies have examined the relation between obesity and colon cancer. The largest prospective study of 750,000 men showed that mortality from colorectal cancer was significantly elevated in men who were > or = 40% overweight. No such increase was found in women. Subsequent studies reported conflicting results. Overweight is likely a surrogate. Other risk factors include a high-fat, energy-dense diet; inadequate consumption of fruit and vegetables; and lack of physical activity, which have been associated with a high incidence of colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer

"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, yet research funding is by far the lowest for lung cancer than for any other cancer compared with respective death rates. Although this discrepancy should appear alarming, one could argue that lung cancer deserves less attention because it is more attributable to poor life choices than other common cancers. Accordingly, the general question that I ask in this article is whether victims of more avoidable diseases, such as lung cancer, deserve to have their needs taken into less consideration than those of less avoidable diseases, on the grounds of either retributive or distributive justice. Such unequal treatment may be the ""penalty"" one incurs for negligent or reckless behavior.

"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the world. CRC is responsible for more than 600,000 deaths annually and incidence rates are increasing in most of the developing countries. Epidemiological and laboratory investigations suggest that environmental factors such as western style dietary habits, tobacco-smoking, and lack of physical activities are considered as risks for CRC. Molecular pathobiology of CRC implicates pro-inflammatory conditions to promote the tumor malignant progression, invasion, and metastasis. It is well known that patients with inflammatory bowel disease are at higher risk of CRC. Many evidences exist reiterating the link between Inflammation and CRC. Inflammation involves interaction between various immune cells, inflammatory cells, chemokines, cytokines, and pro-inflammatory mediators, such as cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways, which may lead to signaling towards, tumor cell proliferation, growth, and invasion. Thus, this review will focus on mechanisms by which pro-inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species play a role in promoting CRC. Based on these mechanisms, various preventive strategies, involving anti-inflammatory agents, such as COX inhibitors, COX-LOX inhibitors, iNOS inhibitors, natural supplements/agents, and synthetic agents, that blocks the inflammatory pathways and suppress CRC are discussed in this review.",Colon_Cancer

"Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Approximately 85 % of lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancers while 15 % are small cell lung cancers. Histologically, following subtypes of non-small cell cancer are distinguished: adenocarcinoma (38.5 % of all lung cancers), squamous cell carcinoma (20 %) and large cell carcinoma (3 %). Over recent years, the incidence of adenocarcinoma has been increasing. Squamous cell carcinoma is more commonly associated with smoking while adenocarcinoma is the most common histological type in non-smokers. The treatment of non-small cell lung cancer is decided according to clinical stage, morphological diagnosis, and the performance status of the patient. Early-stage patients are typically indicated for surgery. In some cases, adjuvant therapy is indicated. In locally advanced and metastatic stages, chemotherapy, biological treatment, and, recently, immunotherapy is indicated. Radiotherapy should also be considered for locally advanced disease.

"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) represents one of the most lethal human cancers and although this tumor type is rare, ATC accounts for the majority of deaths from thyroid cancer. Due to the rarity of ATC, a comprehensive genomic characterization of this tumor type has been challenging, and thus the development of new therapies has been lacking. To date, there is only one mutation-driven targeted therapy for BRAF-mutant ATC. Recent genomic studies have used next generation sequencing to define the genetic landscape of ATC in order to identify new therapeutic targets. Together, these studies have confirmed the role of oncogenic mutations of MAPK pathway as key drivers of differentiated thyroid cancer (BRAF, RAS), and that additional genetic alterations in the PI3K pathway, TP53, and the TERT promoter are necessary for anaplastic transformation. Recent novel findings have linked the high mutational burden associated with ATC with mutations in the Mismatch Repair (MMR) pathway and overactivity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases. Additional novel mutations include cell cycle genes, SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, and histone modification genes. Mutations in RAC1 were also identified in ATC, which have important implications for BRAF-directed therapies. In this review, we summarize these novel findings and the new genetic landscape of ATC.

"Surgical resection is the primary treatment for colon cancer. The introduction and acceptance of laparoscopic colectomy for cancer has been gradual for a number of reasons including the fact that it is technically challenging, has less than dramatic patient benefits, and perhaps most significantly it could theoretically represent a compromise as an oncologic procedure. Evidence suggests that laparoscopic colectomy for colon cancer is safe, feasible, and an oncologic adequate resection can be performed with acceptable operative times and conversion rates. It may result in improved outcomes when performed by experienced surgeons. The recently published results from the largest and first prospective randomized trial with sufficient statistical power have shown that laparoscopic colectomy is as effective as open colectomy in preventing recurrence and death from colon cancer.

"Well-differentiated thyroid cancers can present with nodal metastasis that have undergone cystic degeneration.

"Colon cancer is the third most common cancer globally. The risk of developing colon cancer is influenced by a number of factors that include age and diet, but is primarily a genetic disease, resulting from oncogene over-expression and tumour suppressor gene inactivation. The induction and progression of the disease is briefly outlined, as are the cellular changes that occur in its progression. While colon cancer is uniformly amenable to surgery if detected at the early stages, advanced carcinomas are usually lethal, with metastases to the liver being the most common cause of death. Oncogenes and genetic mutations that occur in colon cancer are featured. The molecules and signals that act to eradicate or initiate the apoptosis cascade in cancer cells, are elucidated, and these include caspases, Fas, Bax, Bid, APC, antisense hTERT, PUMA, 15-LOX-1, ceramide, butyrate, tributyrin and PPARgamma, whereas the molecules which promote colon cancer cell survival are p53 mutants, Bcl-2, Neu3 and COX-2. Cancer therapies aimed at controlling colon cancer are reviewed briefly.",Colon_Cancer
"Individual screening of patients with personal or family history of colon cancer or polyps, or patients with an inflammatory condition of the digestive tract, combined with the generalization of mass screening using Hemoccult, have modified the way colon cancer is diagnosed. The optimization of colon surgery, together with adjuvant chemotherapy, has improved the 5- and 10-year survival. The five-year survival rate is now comprised between 90 percent in patients with stage-I colon cancer, and 65-70 percent in patients with stage-III colon cancer. More than half patients suffer from stage-II (T3-T4 N0) or stage-III (TxN+) cancer, and 30 to 40 percent of these patients experience cancer recurrence without adjuvant therapy within 5 years following surgery. In patients with surgically-resected colon cancer, these recurrences are mostly metastatic (liver, lungs, peritoneum), local recurrences remain uncommon. Metastases are secondary to microscopic tumor foci disseminated away from the primary tumor, non detectable before and during surgery. An adjuvant therapy combining oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine is clearly indicated in patients with stage-III colon tumor (20-percent improvement of survival without recurrence), and can be considered in stage-III patients. This treatment is not indicated in patients with stage-I tumor.",Colon_Cancer
Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) progression imparts reduced patient survival. Tumor resistance and progression can be influenced by Glutathione (GSH) metabolism. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) regulates GSH oxidation to prevent lipid peroxidation of cell membranes during increased oxidative stress and regulates ferroptosis cell death pathway in tumor cells. This study examines the differential ferroptosis effects by GPX4 inhibitors in thyroid cancer cell and 3-D spheroid in vitro models.,Thyroid_Cancer
Medullary thyroid cancer is a tumor of the thyroid C cells that occurs in sporadic and hereditary clinical settings. Genetic testing of at-risk individuals is available and has been applied to patient management. Plasma calcitonin levels are a very sensitive marker for the presence of disease. Surgery offers the best hope for cure and also is an effective modality for managing metastatic and recurrent disease.,Thyroid_Cancer
"Thyroid cancer is considered the most common malignancy that affects the endocrine system. Generally, thyroid cancer derives from follicular epithelial cells, and thyroid cancer is divided into well-differentiated papillary (80% of cases) and follicular (15% of cases) carcinoma. Follicular thyroid cancer is further divided into the conventional and oncocytic (H rthle cell) type, poorly differentiated carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma. Both poorly differentiated and anaplastic carcinoma can arise either de novo, or secondarily from papillary and follicular thyroid cancer. The incidence of thyroid cancer has significantly increased for both males and females of all ages, particularly for females between 55-64 years of age, from 1999 through 2008. The increased rates refer to tumors of all stages, though they were mostly noted in localized disease. Recently, viruses have been implicated in the direct regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the development of metastases. More specifically, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) proteins may potentially lead to the development of metastasis through the regulation of the metastasis suppressor, Nm23, and the control of Twist expression. The significant enhancement of the metastatic potential, through the induction of angiogenesis and changes to the tumor microenvironment, subsequent to viral infection, has been documented, while EMT also contributes to cancer cell permissiveness to viruses. A number of viruses have been identified to be associated with carcinogenesis, and these include lymphotropic herpesviruses, namely EBV and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [KSHV, also known as human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV8)]; two hepatitis viruses, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV); human papillomaviruses (HPVs); human T cell lymphoma virus (HTLV); and a new polyomavirus, Merkel cell polyomavirus identified in 2008. In this review, we examined the association between thyroid cancer and two oncogenic virus families, the herpes and polyoma family viruses, and we discuss their potential role as causative agents in thyroid carcinogenesis.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Overdiagnosis is the detection of a disease that does not do any harm to the patient throughout the lifetime. Thyroid cancer in children is a rare disease; however, since 2011, many children in Fukushima, Japan, have been diagnosed with it, and the number has shown a steady increase to over 200 cases at present. Some experts have stated that this phenomenon is due to overdiagnosis caused by thyroid ultrasound (US)-based thyroid screening detecting self-limiting thyroid cancer, which will not lead to clinical symptoms in the future. Harm caused by overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer is more serious in the young, since it is difficult to perform active surveillance and children diagnosed with cancer are likely to suffer from stigma. Thus, overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the young is not only a health problem but also a problem of human rights. Conflicts of interest among people related to screening programs and some experts with incomplete knowledge on overdiagnosis help to spread misleading opinions together with fear of radiation exposure among residents, which has led to their erroneous understanding of the nature of US-based thyroid screening. Scientific and honest discussions among experts to enhance education of residents and consideration of medical ethics are crucial to prevent the expansion of overdiagnosis.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Cell imaging has entered the 'Big Data' era. New technologies in light microscopy and molecular biology have led to an explosion in high-content, dynamic and multidimensional imaging data. Similar to the 'omics' fields two decades ago, our current ability to process, visualize, integrate and mine this new generation of cell imaging data is becoming a critical bottleneck in advancing cell biology. Computation, traditionally used to quantitatively test specific hypotheses, must now also enable iterative hypothesis generation and testing by deciphering hidden biologically meaningful patterns in complex, dynamic or high-dimensional cell image data. Data science is uniquely positioned to aid in this process. In this Perspective, we survey the rapidly expanding new field of data science in cell imaging. Specifically, we highlight how data science tools are used within current image analysis pipelines, propose a computation-first approach to derive new hypotheses from cell image data, identify challenges and describe the next frontiers where we believe data science will make an impact. We also outline steps to ensure broad access to these powerful tools - democratizing infrastructure availability, developing sensitive, robust and usable tools, and promoting interdisciplinary training to both familiarize biologists with data science and expose data scientists to cell imaging.",Generic
Clinical systemic amyloidosis has been rarely described in patients with lung cancer. A new case of such an association is described with a review of the literature and a discussion about the possible biological mechanisms responsible for the development of systemic amyloidosis in patients with lung cancer.

"There are controversial views and discussions on surgical treatment of thyroid cancer. A retrospective study covering the period from 1979 through 1988 has been conducted by the authors to analyse resective approaches to thyroid cancer. Operations were performed on papillary carcinoma in 37.6% and on follicular carcinoma in 31.8% of the cases. An overall five-year survival rate for differentiated thyroid cancer was recorded from 81.5%, with 100% in stage T1N0M0 (microcarcinoma) according to publications. Hence, much less radical procedures like hemithyroidectomy is fully supported by the authors for microcarcinoma. The total thyroidectomy only should be applied to differentiated thyroid cancer in the advanced stages, to medullary and anaplastic carcinoma.",Thyroid_Cancer

These cell suspensions are sorted using flow cytometry-assisted cell sorting to fractionate the cells into tumor-initiating and nontumor-initiating subsets. Once the cells have been fractionated, they must be functionally tested to determine tumor-forming capacity, the gold standard being the in vivo xenograft assay. Methods have also been developed to grow these cells in vitro in a sphere-forming assay. This unit will describe how to isolate and functionally test colon cancer stem cells, as well as provide advice on the potential challenges of the research.",Colon_Cancer
"Cyanobacteria are blue-green Gram-negative and photosynthetic bacteria which are seen as one of the most morphologically numerous groups of prokaryotes. Because of their ability to fix gaseous nitrogen and carbon dioxide to organic materials, they are known to play important roles in the universal nutrient cycle. Cyanobacteria has emerged as one of the promising resources to combat the issues of global warming, disease outbreaks, nutrition insecurity, energy crises as well as persistent daily human population increases. Cyanobacteria possess significant levels of macro and micronutrient substances which facilitate the versatile popularity to be utilized as human food and protein supplements in many countries such as Asia. Cyanobacteria has been employed as a complementary dietary constituent of feed for poultry and as vitamin and protein supplement in aquatic lives. They are effectively used to deal with numerous tasks in various fields of biotechnology, such as agricultural (including aquaculture), industrial (food and dairy products), environmental (pollution control), biofuel (bioenergy) and pharmaceutical biotechnology (such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant, anticoagulant and antitumor); recently, the growing interest of applying them as biocatalysts has been observed as well. Cyanobacteria are known to generate a numerous variety of bioactive compounds. However, the versatile potential applications of cyanobacteria in biotechnology could be their significant growth rate and survival in severe environmental conditions due to their distinct and unique metabolic pathways as well as active defensive mechanisms. In this review, we elaborated on the versatile cyanobacteria applications in different areas of biotechnology. We also emphasized the factors that could impede the implementation to cyanobacteria applications in biotechnology and the execution of strategies to enhance their effective applications.",Generic

"Patients with thyroid cancer can be safely treated by an experienced endocrine surgeon. More extensive initial surgery such as total or near-total thyroidectomy seems to decrease tumor recurrence and prolong life. When such operations can be done with minimal complications, we believe it is the treatment of choice because even low-risk patients have a 4% or 5% risk of eventually dying of thyroid cancer. If this risk of death from thyroid cancer can be decreased to 1% or 2% and the rate of serious complications is 1% or 2%, the authors believe total thyroidectomy is indicated. Most patients can be discharged within 1 day of total thyroidectomy.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Colon cancer remains the third leading cause of death due to cancer in the US, where it affected more than 145,000 individuals in 2005. Up to 30% of these cases exhibit familial clustering, which means that tens of thousands of individuals have a disease with a potentially definable genetic component. Approximately 3-5% of colon cancers are associated with high-risk, inherited colon cancer syndromes. Identification of the genes that cause these colon cancer syndromes, coupled with additional insights into their clinical course, has led to the development of specific management guidelines--and genetic tests--that can diagnose these familial disorders. These guidelines can be life-saving, not only for the affected patient, but also for their family members.",Colon_Cancer
"Millions of breast imaging exams are performed each year in an effort to reduce the morbidity and mortality of breast cancer. Breast imaging exams are performed for cancer screening, diagnostic work-up of suspicious findings, evaluating extent of disease in recently diagnosed breast cancer patients, and determining treatment response. Yet, the interpretation of breast imaging can be subjective, tedious, time-consuming, and prone to human error. Retrospective and small reader studies suggest that deep learning (DL) has great potential to perform medical imaging tasks at or above human-level performance, and may be used to automate aspects of the breast cancer screening process, improve cancer detection rates, decrease unnecessary callbacks and biopsies, optimize patient risk assessment, and open up new possibilities for disease prognostication. Prospective trials are urgently needed to validate these proposed tools, paving the way for real-world clinical use. New regulatory frameworks must also be developed to address the unique ethical, medicolegal, and quality control issues that DL algorithms present. In this article, we review the basics of DL, describe recent DL breast imaging applications including cancer detection and risk prediction, and discuss the challenges and future directions of artificial intelligence-based systems in the field of breast cancer.",Generic
"Successful treatment of colon cancer is founded on surgical resection of the primary lesion and the regional lymph nodes. The significant number of patients so resected who experience no recurrence, even with positive lymph nodes, indicates that the disease still was confined regionally and that the therapy was effective.

The target population should be clearly defined and selected in such a way that, given the likely sensitivity and specificity of the test, an acceptable predictive value will be achieved. 2. As far as possible, the target population should be limited to those at particular risk of the disease in order to give a reasonable prevalence of detection when such individuals at risk can be identified. 3. There should be a reasonable expectation of reaching the target population and of achieving reasonable compliance in response to invitations to attend. The expected level of compliance should be stated. 4. There should be a reasonable expectation that recommendations for further diagnostic evaluation will be complied with by individuals who have a positive test. 5. There should be an agreed-upon policy on the classification of borderline abnormalities and also on their management, as well as on recommendations for their follow-up. 6. There should be a reasonable expectation that recommendations for appropriate management of lesions discovered by a screening program will be complied with both by the individual with the lesion and by the physicians responsible for his health care.",Colon_Cancer
"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The persisting grim lung cancer incidence and mortality figures argue powerfully for new approaches such as chemoprevention for controlling this disease. Retinoids are among the most intensively studied cancer chemoprevention agents, including in the lung. Several randomized clinical or translational chemoprevention trials (e.g., of retinoids, beta-carotene, or combined folic acid and vitamin B(12)) have been conducted in lung pre-malignancy. Retinoid studies have produced important data on molecular/cellular markers of lung carcinogenesis, e.g., loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 3p and 9p and retinoic acid receptor-beta (RAR-beta). Two large randomized trials with a lung cancer endpoint, the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene (ATBC) Prevention Study and the Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET), found that beta-carotene (+/- retinol) was harmful (in smokers). Recently completed lung-second-primary-tumor-prevention trials include the retinoids retinyl palmitate and 13-cis-retinoic acid (13cRA) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Vitamin E and selenium show promise for lung cancer prevention, based on positive secondary/subset analyses of three large-scale, randomized National Cancer Institute (NCI) cancer prevention trials.

"Ten of 502 patients presenting with thyroid cancer were hyperthyroid due to Graves' disease (4 patients), multinodular goitre (3), an autonomous functioning nodule (1) and a large functioning tumour (2). In addition eight patients had a past history of Graves' disease and four of hyperthyroidism associated with multinodular goitre. Mortality in patients with Graves' disease and with multinodular goitre appeared similar to that of other patients of comparable age. Both patients with large functioning tumours died from progressive disease. Concentration 131I by tumour metastases was present in one patient with active Graves' disease who had a high serum concentration of TSH-receptor binding antibodies, indicating that these antibodies may chronically stimulate tumour function. The potential for 131I concentration by tumour when TSH secretion is suppressed should therefore be determined in patients with Graves' disease and if demonstrable tumour function is present, reflecting stimulation by Graves' immunoglobulins, then elimination of tumour remnants is particularly important.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Of the 740 patients with primary lung cancer operated on at our department between January, 1982 and December, 1991, 108 (14.6%) underwent extended operation involving combined resection of adjacent organs.

Surgical treatment for stage III advanced lung cancer is controversial, but the 5-year survival rates in those who underwent combined resection of the parietal pleura, thoracic wall including the ribs, left atrium, and aorta were not lower than that in all patients with stage III lung cancer. Especially, long-term survivals of 5 years and 11 months and 10 years and 6 months were obtained in patients who underwent resection of the left atrium, and 6-year survival was observed in a patient who underwent resection of the aorta, suggesting that extended resection is effective in some cases.

"In countries where prolonged smoking of manufactured cigarettes is a widely established habit, it is responsible for about 90% of lung cancer. As lung cancer is usually incurable, even with expensive technology, the key to its control lies in prevention.

It is recommended that each country establish a national council of 'tobacco or health' to coordinate a comprehensive tobacco control programme. This programme should incorporate data collection, including evaluation of specific anti-tobacco measures; legislative measures, including strong, rotating health warnings, limits on harmful substances, establishment of smoke-free areas, bans on any new forms of tobacco use, and a total ban on all direct or indirect promotion of tobacco products; health education campaigns; and taxation and price policies. The support and involvement of the medical profession is vital. Obstacles to success include the effect of advertising revenue in silencing the media, the inertia of governments and the medical profession, but most importantly the tobacco industry--the largest, wealthiest, most determined and strongest opposition to tobacco control worldwide.",Lung_Cancer
"Machine learning applications in neurosurgery are increasingly reported for diverse tasks such as faster and more accurate preoperative diagnosis, enhanced lesion characterization, as well as surgical outcome, complications and healthcare cost prediction. Even though the pertinent literature in pituitary surgery is less extensive with respect to other neurosurgical diseases, past research attempted to answer clinically relevant questions to better assist surgeons and clinicians. In the present chapter we review reported ML applications in pituitary surgery including differential diagnosis, preoperative lesion characterization (immunohistochemistry, cavernous sinus invasion, tumor consistency), surgical outcome and complication predictions (gross total resection, tumor recurrence, and endocrinological remission, cerebrospinal fluid leak, postoperative hyponatremia). Moreover, we briefly discuss from a practical standpoint the current barriers to clinical translation of machine learning research. On the topic of pituitary surgery, published reports can be considered mostly preliminary, requiring larger training populations and strong external validation. Thoughtful selection of clinically relevant outcomes of interest and transversal application of model development pipeline-together with accurate methodological planning and multicenter collaborations-have the potential to overcome current limitations and ultimately provide additional tools for more informed patient management.",Generic
"Environmental neuroscience is an emerging field devoted to the scientific study of brain-mediated, bidirectional relationships between organisms and their social and physical environments. A key feature of environmental neuroscience is the rigorous quantification of environmental features that affect the brain and subsequent behavior. In addition, environmental neuroscience considers factors that vary across multiple temporal and spatial scales that interact to produce behavior (e.g., synapses, neural circuits, cognition, local social interactions, citywide social interactions, citywide physical structures). Environmental neuroscientists then measure the spatial and temporal dynamics of the interactions between different levels of analysis. For example, we demonstrate through hierarchical systems theory and mathematical modeling how interacting with urban greenspace may reduce psychopathology via improvements in neurocognitive functioning, which, in turn, may increase social interactions. This example illustrates how different levels of analysis (e.g., neurocognitive factors, the physical environment, and the social environment) may be combined to understand behavior in novel ways. In addition, we advocate for the collection of data across these scales and measuring their interactions, which will generate rich data sets that will continue to yield insights as new ways to model these complex multilevel systems are developed. We believe that examining all of these levels of analysis at different temporal and spatial scales in addition to modeling their relationships will lead to advances in understanding behavior.

We moreover discuss two of our own cases, which had come to our attention within a few months of one another. Eleven cases were follicular cancer, eight cases were papillary cancer, two cases were medullary cancer, and one case was an insular cancer. In nine cases, PM was the first sign of the disease. Cranial nerve involvement was the most common sign of its presence, and no neuroradiological imaging could lead to a sure diagnosis of PM. Neurosurgical intervention was performed in almost all cases, and post-surgical treatment comprised radioiodine, external beam radiotherapy, and radiosurgery. Prognosis was poor for larger metastases, cranial nerve palsy disappeared in only one case, and in only one case of intrasellar metastasis was the disease cured. PM from thyroid cancer are rare, but are burdened by a poor prognosis.

Among nondietary factors, evidence indicates familiality, obesity and atmospheric pollution to be contributory, while parity, physical activity, solar radiation, high social class, estrogen use, and aspirin use, appear protective.

"Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are at increased risk of developing colon cancer, confirming that chronic inflammation predisposes to development of tumors. Moreover, it appears that colon cancers that do not develop as a complication of inflammatory bowel disease are also driven by inflammation, because it has been shown that regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) lowers the mortality from sporadic colon cancer and results in regression of adenomas in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients, who inherit a mutation in the Apc gene. Colorectal cancer therefore represents a paradigm for the link between inflammation and cancer. Inflammation is driven by soluble factors, cytokines and chemokines, which can be produced by tumor cells themselves or, more often, by the cells recruited to the tumor microenvironment. Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines promote growth of tumor cells, perturb their differentiation, and support the survival of cancer cells. Tumor cells become addicted to inflammatory stroma, suggesting that the tumor microenvironment represents an attractive target for preventive and therapeutic strategies. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF , IL-6 and IL-1 , or transcription factors that are required for signaling by these cytokines, including NF- B and STATs, are indeed emerging as potential targets for anticancer therapy. TNF antagonists are in phase I/II clinical trials and have been shown to be well tolerated in patients with solid tumors, and IL-1 antagonists that ameliorate several inflammatory disorders characterized by excessive IL-1 production, will likely follow. Therefore, development of drugs that normalize the tumor microenvironment or interrupt the crosstalk between the tumor and the tumor microenvironment is an important approach to the management of cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Carcinoma of the colon is common and its incidence varies according to the geographical location and dietary habits. The aims of this paper are, first, to review the current epidemiological data on the incidence and mortality of colon cancer in postmenopausal women using hormone replacement therapy (HRT); second, to review the published data on the prevalence of estrogen receptors in healthy and malignant colonic tissue; and third, to examine the available evidence of gene silencing as applicable to this and other neoplastic conditions. Estrogen use confers overall protection, with a reduction in the incidence of colon adenoma and carcinoma of about 30%. Estrogen use reduces the colon cancer-related mortality. The risk of colon cancer is decreased among current and recent users of postmenopausal HRT but the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. Estrogen acts either on a single major transformation step in the oncogenetic process, or is involved in multiple events that avert the course of this transformation. Aberrant methylation of the CpG islands in the promoter regions of the estrogen receptor gene, as well as of other genes, is equivalent to the silencing of that gene, with the consequence of inactivation, or reduced expression, of a number of genes downstream, including tumor suppressor genes. This epigenetic mechanism, when reversed, suppresses the growth of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The ubiquitous distribution of the estrogen receptor genes and their isoforms, in a tissue-specific manner, opens new avenues for the understanding of cellular behavior in health and disease.",Colon_Cancer
"A number of molecular abnormalities have been described in association with the progression from normal thyroid tissue to benign adenomas to well-differentiated and finally anaplastic epithelial thyroid cancer. These include upregulation of proliferative factors, such as growth hormones and oncogenes, downregulation of apoptotic and cell-cycle inhibitory factors, such as tumor suppressors, disruption of normal cell-to-cell interactions, and cellular immortalization. The progression model for thyroid carcinoma has not been proven, but evidence suggests that an evolutionary molecular process is involved, especially in the development of follicular thyroid cancers for which there are distinct intermediate phenotypes. We present a comprehensive evaluation of factors involved in thyroid tumorigenesis and attempt to describe preliminary attributes of a progression model. The organization of this model should also provide a template for the incorporation of new information as it is derived from large-scale genomic studies.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Image-guided percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy (PTNB) is a well-established and minimally invasive technique for evaluating pulmonary nodules. Implementation of a national lung screening program and increased use of chest computed tomography have contributed to the frequent identification of indeterminate pulmonary nodules that may require tissue sampling. The advent of biomarker-driven lung cancer therapy has led to increased use of repeat PTNB after diagnosis. Percutaneous insertion of markers for preoperative localization of small nodules can aid in minimally invasive surgery and radiation treatment planning. This article discusses PTNB, patient selection, and biopsy technique, including minimizing and managing complications.",Lung_Cancer

"According to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, colon cancer results from accumulating somatic gene mutations; environmental growth factors accelerate and augment this process. For example, diets rich in meat and fat increase fecal bile acids and colon cancer risk. In rodent cancer models, increased fecal bile acids promote colon dysplasia. Conversely, in rodents and in persons with inflammatory bowel disease, low-dose ursodeoxycholic acid treatment alters fecal bile acid composition and attenuates colon neoplasia. In the course of elucidating the mechanism underlying these actions, we discovered that bile acids interact functionally with intestinal muscarinic receptors. The present communication reviews muscarinic receptor expression in normal and neoplastic colon epithelium, the role of autocrine signaling following synthesis and release of acetylcholine from colon cancer cells, post-muscarinic receptor signaling including the role of transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptors and activation of the ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, the structural biology and metabolism of bile acids and evidence for functional interaction of bile acids with muscarinic receptors on human colon cancer cells. In murine colon cancer models, deficiency of subtype 3 muscarinic receptors attenuates intestinal neoplasia; a proof-of-concept supporting muscarinic receptor signaling as a therapeutic target for colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"With the development of newer forms of technology such as low-dose spiral computed tomography, there has been a resurgent interest in screening for lung cancer.

"Thyroid cancer incidence is on the rise; however, fortunately, the death rate is stable. Most persons with well-differentiated thyroid cancer have a low risk of recurrence at the time of diagnosis and can expect a normal life expectancy. Over the last two decades, guidelines have recommended less aggressive therapy for low-risk cancer and a more personalized approach to treatment of thyroid cancer overall. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) thyroid cancer guidelines recommend hemithyroidectomy as an acceptable surgical treatment option for low-risk thyroid cancer. Given this change in treatment paradigms, an increasing number of people are undergoing hemithyroidectomy rather than total or near-total thyroidectomy as their primary surgical treatment of thyroid cancer. The postoperative follow-up of hemithyroidectomy patients differs from those who have undergone total or near-total thyroidectomy, and the long-term monitoring with imaging and biomarkers can also be different. This article reviews indications for hemithyroidectomy, as well as postoperative considerations and management recommendations for those who have undergone hemithyroidectomy.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the worst human malignancies, with an associated median survival of only 5 months. It is resistant to conventional thyroid cancer therapies, including radioiodine and thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression. Cancer immunotherapy has emerged over the past few decades as a transformative approach to treating a wide variety of cancers. However, immunotherapy for ATC is still in the experimental stage. This review will cover several strategies of immunotherapy and discuss the possible application of these strategies in the treatment of ATC (such as targeted therapy for tumor-associated macrophages, cancer vaccines, adoptive immunotherapy, monoclonal antibodies and immune checkpoint blockade) with the hope of improving the prognosis of ATC in the future.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The primary mode of therapy for colon cancer continues to be surgery. Although little has changed in the technical aspects of colonic resection, a great deal of research has taken place to develop procedures that enhance staging of disease, optimize postoperative recovery, and improve outcomes in obstructed patients without compromising cancer-related morbidity and mortality. This review explores the current use of laparoscopy, sentinel node biopsy, intraoperative ultrasound, and colonic stents in the elective and emergent management of colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer
"Pneumothorax is a rare lung cancer manifestation. We report 2 patients in which pneumothorax occurred as a first manifestation of lung cancer. Postoperative lung tissue examination after pneumothorax showed lung cancer by chance. One patient had dissemination suspected due to ruptured bulla with adenocarcinoma. Both immediately underwent additional lobectomy with mediastinal lymphadenectomy after lung cancer was diagnosed, but we detected lung cancer recurrence in the bottom of the pleural cavity on the same side some 11 months after radical surgery in the patient suspected of dissemination. We could resect it completely, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. The possibility of lung cancer should thus be considered in pneumothorax patients, even if middle-aged.",Lung_Cancer
"The survival from bronchogenic carcinoma is highly dependent upon stage at the time of treatment. This is particularly true for squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma, but holds true for small cell carcinoma as well. The problem presented to the medical profession has been to find a practical means of detecting lung cancer while it is still at an early stage. Three studies in progress have indicated that a larger proportion of the patients may be found to have early stage lung cancer when screened with a combination of chest X-rays and sputum cytology. However, the detection of these early stage cases has not yet been translated into an improvement in the overall mortality rate from lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer
"The incidence of thyroid cancer (TC) has increased worldwide over the past four decades. TC is divided into three main histological types: differentiated (papillary and follicular TC), undifferentiated (poorly differentiated and anaplastic TC), and medullary TC, arising from TC cells. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms associated to the pathogenesis of different types of TC and their clinical relevance. In the last years, progresses in the genetic characterization of TC have provided molecular markers for diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment targets. Recently, papillary TC, the most frequent form of TC, has been reclassified into two molecular subtypes, named BRAF-like and RAS-like, associated to a different range of cancer risks. Similarly, the genetic characterization of follicular TC has been proposed to complement the new histopathological classification in order to estimate the prognosis. New analyses characterized a comprehensive molecular profile of medullary TC, raising the role of RET mutations. More recent evidences suggested that immune microenvironment associated to TC may play a critical role in tumor invasion, with potential immunotherapeutic implications in advanced and metastatic TC. Several types of ancillary approaches have been developed to improve the diagnostic value of fine needle aspiration biopsies in indeterminate thyroid nodules. Finally, liquid biopsy, as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for body fluid genotyping, brings a new prospective of disease and therapy monitoring. Despite all these novelties, much work remains to be done to fully understand the pathogenesis and biological behaviors of the different types of TC and to transfer this knowledge in clinical practice.",Thyroid_Cancer
"The percentages of activated lymphocytes in colon cancers were compared to clinical features of the tumors and to functional characteristics of the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in order to evaluate the role of activated TIL in controlling tumor growth. The TIL isolated from colon cancers contained 80 +/- 6% T cells [cluster designation (CD) 2+], 42 +/- 9% CD4+ cells, 27 +/- 9% CD8+ cells, 17 +/- 5% cells (surface immunoglobulin or SIg+), 6 +/- 2% null cells (CD2-, SIg-), 6 +/- 4% Leu 7+ cells, 1 +/- 0% macrophages (CDw 14+), and no plasma cells (PCA+). The lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) isolated from adjacent colonic mucosa contained a similar distribution but with fewer CD8+ (10 +/- 5%) and Leu 7+ (0.6 +/- 0.3%) lymphocytes (P less than 0.05). More TIL than LPL expressed the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor (9 +/- 8% vs 1 +/- 0.8% CD25+ cells; P less than 0.05) and the transferrin receptor (4 +/- 5% vs 0.3 +/- 0.6% T9+ cells; P less than 0.05). Those TIL expressing activation antigens were CD2+, SIg-. The percentage of TIL that were CD25+ did not correlate with the extent of tumor spread, with the degree of tumor differentiation, nor with the percentage of HLA-DR+ tumor cells. However, there were significantly more CD25+ TIL from tumors located in the left colon, particularly small lesions, than from tumors located in the right colon (P less than 0.05). The proliferation of TIL preparations cultured with medium alone, with mitogens, or with IL-2 did not vary according to the percentage of CD25+ lymphocytes in the TIL. T cells may be activated by foreign surface determinants on tumor cells, particularly in small, left-sided lesions.",Colon_Cancer
"Vasohibin-1 (VASH1) is an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor.However, the clinical relevance of VASH1 in colon cancer and its regulations on cancer angiogenesis and cancer cell biological characteristics are still unknown. Here we showed that stromal VASH1 levels were negatively correlated with tumor size, advanced clinical stage and distant metastases in colon cancer patients. Overexpression of VASH1 in colon cancer cells induced apoptosis and senescence, inhibiting cancer cell growth and colony formation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. In addition, knockdown of VASH1 in cancer cells promoted cell growth, adhesion and migration in vitro, and enhanced tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo.",Colon_Cancer
"Thyroid cancer incidence is rapidly increasing due to increased detection and diagnosis of indolent thyroid cancer, i.e. cancer that is likely to be clinically insignificant. Clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features predicting indolent behavior of thyroid cancer are still largely unknown and unstudied. Existing clinicopathologic staging systems are useful for providing prognosis in the context of treated thyroid cancer but are not designed for and are inadequate for predicting indolent behavior. Ultrasound studies have primarily focused on discrimination between malignant and benign nodules; some studies show promising data on using sonographic features for predicting indolence but are still in their early stages. Similarly, molecular studies are being developed to better characterize thyroid cancer and improve the yield of fine needle aspiration biopsy, but definite markers of indolent thyroid cancer have yet to be identified. Nonetheless, active surveillance has been introduced as an alternative to surgery in the case of indolent thyroid microcarcinoma, and protocols for safe surveillance are in development. As increased detection of thyroid cancer is all but inevitable, increased research on predicting indolent behavior is needed to avoid an epidemic of overtreatment.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Suppression of a nuclear pore protein Nup358/RanBP2 is linked to mitotic cell death, but the clinical relevance of this link is unknown. In a recent issue of Cell, Vecchione et al. (2016) show that in approximately 10% of BRAF-like colorectal cancer (CC) patients, Nup358/RanBP2 is critical for survival. Treatment with vinorelbine, a microtubule-depolymerizing drug that inhibits mitosis, might be a potential treatment for these CCs.",Colon_Cancer
"Immunotherapy is a conceptually attractive approach, because it is highly specific and can deal with disseminated disease with minimal impact on normal tissues. Ability to induce antigen-specific immune responses in patients with lung cancer is now well established in early-phase clinical trials using a variety of immunotherapeutic approaches. Although no immunotherapy is likely to be a panacea, randomized phase IIB studies offer promise of therapeutic activity in both early- and late-stage lung cancer. This review will cover basic concepts of immunotherapy, provide perspective on vaccine development, and update the status of ongoing clinical trials in lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer
"Thyroid cancer is the most prevalent endocrine neoplasia in the world. The use of mathematical models on the development of tumors has yielded numerous results in this field and modeling with differential equations is present in many papers on cancer. In order to know the use of mathematical models with differential equations or similar in the study of thyroid cancer, studies since 2006 to date was reviewed. Systems with ordinary or partial differential equations were the means most frequently adopted by the authors. The models deal with tumor growth, effective half-life of radioiodine applied after thyroidectomy, the treatment with iodine-131, thyroid volume before thyroidectomy, and others. The variables usually employed in the models includes tumor volume, thyroid volume, amount of iodine, thyroglobulin and thyroxine hormone, radioiodine activity, and physical characteristics such as pressure, density, and displacement of the thyroid molecules. In conclusion, the mathematical models used so far with differential equations approach several aspects of thyroid cancer, including participation in methods of execution or follow-up of treatments. With the development of new models, an increase in the current understanding of the detection, evolution, and treatment of diseases is a step that should be considered.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Radiotherapy is a key cancer treatment, which greatly modified its practice in recent years thanks to medical imaging and technical improvements. The systematic use of computed tomography (CT) for treatment planning, the imaging fusion/co-registration between CT/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT/positron emission tomography (PET) improve target identification/selection and delineation. New irradiation techniques such as image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), stereotactic radiotherapy or hadron therapy offer a more diverse therapeutic armamentarium to patients together with lower toxicity. Radiotherapy, as well as medical oncology, tends to offer a personalized treatment to patients thanks to the IGRT, which takes into account the inter- or intra-fraction anatomic variations. IGRT leads to adaptive radiotherapy (ART) with a new planification in the treatment course in order to decrease toxicity and improve tumor control. The use of systemic therapies with radiations needs to be studied in order to improve efficiency without increasing toxicities from these multimodal approaches. Finally, radiotherapy advances were impacted by radiotherapy accidents like Epinal. They led to an increased quality control with the intensification of identity control, the emergence of in vivo dosimetry or the experience feedback committee in radiotherapy. We will illustrate through the example of lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer
"Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a naturally occurring phenomenon with the capacity to render useless all known antibiotics in the fight against bacterial infections. Although bacterial resistance appeared before any human life form, this process has accelerated in the past years. Important causes of AR in modern times could be the over-prescription of antibiotics, the presence of faulty infection-prevention strategies, pollution in overcrowded areas, or the use of antibiotics in agriculture and farming, together with a decreased interest from the pharmaceutical industry in researching and testing new antibiotics. The last cause is primarily due to the high costs of developing antibiotics. The aim of the present review is to highlight the techniques that are being developed for the identification of new antibiotics to assist this lengthy process, using artificial intelligence (AI). AI can shorten the preclinical phase by rapidly generating many substances based on algorithms created by machine learning (ML) through techniques such as neural networks (NN) or deep learning (DL). Recently, a text mining system that incorporates DL algorithms was used to help and speed up the data curation process. Moreover, new and old methods are being used to identify new antibiotics, such as the combination of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods with ML or Raman spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF MS combined with NN, offering faster and easier interpretation of results. Thus, AI techniques are important additional tools for researchers and clinicians in the race for new methods of overcoming bacterial resistance.",Generic
"We assessed the usefulness of endobronchial ultrasonography in the diagnosis of lung cancer. We performed a needle-puncture experiment on 45 normal tissue specimens to determine the luminar structure of the tracheobronchial wall. In addition, we compared the ultrasonographic determination of tumor invasion in 24 lung cancer patients with the histopathological findings. The cartilaginous portions of the extrapulmonary bronchi and the intrapulmonary bronchi exhibited a five-layered structure. Starting on the lumen side, the first layer (hyperechoic) was a marginal echo, the second (hypoechoic) was the submucosal tissue, the third (hyperechoic) was the marginal echo on the inner side of the bronchial cartilage, the fourth (hypoechoic) was bronchial cartilage, and the fifth (hyperechoic) was the marginal echo on the outer side of the cartilage. In the membranous portions, the first layer (hyperechoic) was a marginal echo, the second (hypoechoic) was smooth muscle, and the third (hyperechoic) corresponded to the adventitia. Comparisons between the ultrasonograms and the histopathological findings in 24 lung cancer patients revealed that depth diagnosis was the same in 23 lesions (95.8%) and different in 1 lesion (4.2%). We describe the usefulness of endobronchial ultrasonography in the diagnosis of peribronchial lymph nodes and peripheral pulmonary lesions.",Lung_Cancer
"Rapid technologic advances are allowing for the development of algorithms to predict both patient prognosis, and possibly, responsiveness to specific therapeutic interventions. Such classifiers may potentially be based on hundreds or thousands of possible factors, including data from genomic, proteomic, pathologic, or other factors. As such, in the absence of careful experimental design, there is considerable potential for an over-optimistic assessment of a classifier's true performance in the clinical setting. Here, I describe a multi-step methodology for the development and assessment of genomic classifiers in the setting of colon cancer. Critical issues include the stability and reproducibility of the assay methodology, appropriate choice of patient population, proper segregation of data into learning and validation cohorts, inclusion of known prognostic and predictive factors (eg, staging), and a critical examination of the most relevant performance characteristics. The need for prospective vs. retrospective confirmation is also discussed.",Colon_Cancer
"Lung cancer is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Overall survival has only improved slightly despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Molecularly targeted agents are currently being studied in all treatment settings including that of chemoprevention, which is defined as the use of natural or synthetic agents to interrupt the process of carcinogenesis and to prevent or delay tumour occurrence. Lung cancer has become an increasingly difficult problem to treat with standard therapies and chemopreventive strategies have been developed. Progress in chemoprevention is reliant on the collaborative efforts of researchers in basic science and clinical settings who study the biology of lung cancer with the goal of uncovering new mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Small molecules which target specific receptors or mutations such as inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor or RAS will have an increasingly significant role as they are associated with more tolerable side-effects and may prove more effective. Development of a risk model with intermediate endpoints is essential for future chemoprevention studies.",Lung_Cancer
"Despite many advances and optimization in colon cancer treatment, tumor recurrence and metastases make the development of new therapies necessary. Colon cancer stem cells (CCSCs) are considered as the main triggering factor of cancer progression, recurrence, and metastasis. CCSCs as a result of accumulated genetic and epigenetic alterations and also complex interconnection with the tumor microenvironment (TME) can evolve and convert to full malignant cells. Mounting evidence suggests that in cancer therapy both CCSCs and non-CCSCs in TME have to be regarded to break through the limitation of current therapies. In this regard, stem cell capabilities of some non-CCSCs may arise inside the TME condition. Therefore, a deep knowledge of regulatory mechanisms, heterogeneity, specific markers, and signaling pathways of CCSCs and their interconnection with TME components is needed to improve the treatment of colorectal cancer and the patient's life quality. In this review, we address current different targeted therapeutic options that target cell surface markers and signaling pathways of CCSCs and other components of TME. Current challenges and future perspectives of colon cancer personalized therapy are also provided here. Taken together, based on the deep understanding of biology of CCSCs and using three-dimensional culture technologies, it can be possible to reach successful colon cancer eradication and improvise combination targeted therapies against CCSCs and TME.",Colon_Cancer
"A 64-year-old female patient was admitted to our outpatient clinic with pleuritic chest pain, non-productive cough, and dyspnea. She expectorated three stones (lithoptysis) before bronchoscopy. She underwent positron emission tomography-computed tomography, which revealed a hyper metabolic mass in the right upper lobe of her lung. Three months later, the mass formation appeared as a patchy consolidation in the first control thoracic computed tomography examination. In conclusion, postobstructive consolidation due to broncholithiasis, which is very rare, should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of hyper metabolic mass. The simplest incidental diagnostic finding of broncholithiasis is the rare lithoptysis.",Lung_Cancer
"Tumor angiogenesis is a complicated process that is regulated by numerous factors simultaneously and in a coordinated fashion. Angiogenic factors drive the process of neovascularization, but the initiation of angiogenesis involves priming of endothelial cells so that they will respond to mitogenic stimuli. The angiopoietins (Ang) -1 and -2 mediate endothelial cell stability through binding to their endothelial cell-specific receptor, Tie-2. Ang-1 leads to endothelial cell stability, and, in vivo, to an actual decrease in angiogenesis. This is likely due to its ability to enhance adhesion to the perivascular tissues. In contrast, Ang-2 leads to endothelial cell instability and may be an initiating factor in angiogenesis, priming endothelial cells for mitogenic signals. Thus, a novel antiangiogenic strategy may be one that leads to enhanced endothelial cell stability, thereby protecting endothelial cells from standard angiogenic stimuli. This may ultimately lead to tumor dormancy by transforming a rapidly growing tumor into an indolent tumor.",Colon_Cancer
"We explore unique considerations involved in fitting machine learning (ML) models to data with very high precision, as is often required for science applications. We empirically compare various function approximation methods and study how they scale with increasing parameters and data. We find that neural networks (NNs) can often outperform classical approximation methods on high-dimensional examples, by (we hypothesize) auto-discovering and exploiting modular structures therein. However, neural networks trained with common optimizers are less powerful for low-dimensional cases, which motivates us to study the unique properties of neural network loss landscapes and the corresponding optimization challenges that arise in the high precision regime. To address the optimization issue in low dimensions, we develop training tricks which enable us to train neural networks to extremely low loss, close to the limits allowed by numerical precision.",Generic
"Cybersecurity has seen an increasing frequency and impact of cyberattacks and exposure of Protected Health Information (PHI). The uptake of an Electronic Medical Record (EMR), the exponential adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the threat surface presented for cyberattack by the healthcare sector. Within healthcare generally and, more specifically, within anaesthesia and Intensive Care, there has been an explosion in wired and wireless devices used daily in the care of almost every patient-the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT); ventilators, anaesthetic machines, infusion pumps, pacing devices, organ support and a plethora of monitoring modalities. All of these devices, once connected to a hospital network, present another opportunity for a malevolent party to access the hospital systems, either to gain PHI for financial, political or other gain or to attack the systems directly to cause erroneous monitoring, altered settings of any device and even to access the EMR via this IoMT window. This exponential increase in the IoMT and the increasing wireless connectivity of anaesthesia and ICU devices as well as implantable devices presents a real and present danger to patient safety. There has, at the same time, been a chronic underfunding of cybersecurity in healthcare. This lack of cybersecurity investment has left the sector exposed, and with the monetisation of PHI, the introduction of technically unsecure IoT devices for monitoring and direct patient care, the healthcare sector is presenting itself for further devastating cyberattacks or breaches of PHI. Coupled with the immense strain that the COVID-19 pandemic has placed on healthcare and the changes in working patterns of many caregivers, this has further amplified the exposure of the sector to cyberattacks.",Generic
"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a very severe disease, being its incidence increasingly reported and, nowadays, successfully treatable only when surgery is deemed to be feasible. Furthermore, the disease and the clinical effects related to the complementary therapies (radio and/or chemotherapy) may strongly affect, frequently with dramatic clinical side effects, the patient's ability to endure physical exercise. In such context, the PR(PR), which has already been proved to be useful and effective in other diseases such as COPD, could play a pivotal role. The aim of this review article is, therefore, to analyze the pertinent data recently reported in English literature in order to highlight the role of rehabilitation as complementary therapy in the management of patients with NSCLC. The evidence currently available suggests that, when surgery is indicated, PR is a safe and feasible option, both during pre-operative and post-operative timing.The safety and feasibility of rehabilitation are proven even in inoperable patients, although to date, little evidence has been reported on its role in the overall management of such complex diseases.",Lung_Cancer

"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved vandetanib in April 2011 for the treatment of unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). In Europe it was approved in March 2012, but only for the treatment of aggressive and symptomatic MTC. This small molecule is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of several growth factors involved in cellular proliferation and angiogenesis, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 2 and 3 (VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3). In addition, vandetanib is an inhibitor of the RET (rearranged during transfection) gene, a proto-oncogene often mutated in familial MTC. Since MTC is a rare disease, for which no previous medical therapies are approved, vandetanib is the first drug shown to be effective in a large phase III trial treating patients with metastatic or locally advanced MTC. Common adverse events are diarrhea, nausea, hypertension, headache and QT prolongation that are manageable and are commonly outweighed by the benefits of vandetanib in terms of delaying disease progression and inducing tumor response.",Thyroid_Cancer

"The gene expression program induced by NRF2 transcription factor plays a critical role in cell defense responses against a broad variety of cellular stresses, most importantly oxidative stress. NRF2 stability is fine-tuned regulated by KEAP1, which drives its degradation in the absence of oxidative stress. In the context of cancer, NRF2 cytoprotective functions were initially linked to anti-oncogenic properties. However, in the last few decades, growing evidence indicates that NRF2 acts as a tumor driver, inducing metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy. Constitutive activation of NRF2 has been found to be frequent in several tumors, including some lung cancer sub-types and it has been associated to the maintenance of a malignant cell phenotype. This apparently contradictory effect of the NRF2/KEAP1 signaling pathway in cancer (cell protection against cancer versus pro-tumoral properties) has generated a great controversy about its functions in this disease. In this review, we will describe the molecular mechanism regulating this signaling pathway in physiological conditions and summarize the most important findings related to the role of NRF2/KEAP1 in lung cancer. The focus will be placed on NRF2 activation mechanisms, the implication of those in lung cancer progression and current therapeutic strategies directed at blocking NRF2 action.",Lung_Cancer

In addition, robotic-assisted colectomy appears to offer comparable outcomes to laparoscopic colectomy with limited long-term outcomes data. Prolonged operating time, increased costs and learning curve are the major drawbacks of robotic colectomy for colon cancer.

"Familial occurrence in excess of that expected by chance is common among cases of colon cancer. Only a small fraction of these familial cases arise from well-described syndromes. There are epidemiologic, colonoscopic, genealogic data base and large prospective studies that characterize the familial occurrence and risk for common colon cancer. Kindred studies suggest that common familial occurrence arises from inherited susceptibility of a mild to moderate magnitude. The responsible genes are yet to be identified, though a number of candidate genes have been suggested. Clinical features, especially age at diagnosis and number of first-degree relatives with colon cancer, already allow stratification of familial risk. Risk stratification is important for colon cancer screening, as some higher-risk persons should probably have more intensive screening. Research is needed to identify the genes or their polymorphisms that give rise to common inherited susceptibility for colon cancer, to examine how susceptibility genes interact with environmental factors and give rise to colonic neoplasms and to verify suggested screening approaches that incorporate familial risk.",Colon_Cancer

"Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with tegafur-uracil has become the standard of care for patients with completely resected stage I adenocarcinoma according to the positive result from phase III trial conducted in Japan. The effectiveness of tegafur-gimeracil-oteracil potassium in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is now under investigation in a phase III trial in the first-line treatment in combination with platinum agent as well as in second-line treatment as monotherapy. The evidence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as gefitinib and erlotinib was first confirmed as the second-line treatment for non-selective patients with advanced NSCLC. However, now it is essential to examine some active EGFR gene mutations such as exon 19 deletion or L858R in exon 21, the novel predictive factor for high efficacy of EGFR-TKI, in terms of the risk-benefit balance. For patients with EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC, the first-line treatment with gefitinib had achieved a significant prolongation of progression-free survival compared with standard platinum doublet chemotherapy in a few phase III trials, and became a new standard of care. Gefitinib is highly effective for patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutation even if their performance status is poor, although one should always pay careful attention to fatal interstitial lung disease.",Lung_Cancer
"Colon cancer remains a significant global health concern. The impact of specific dietary components on colon tissue likely depends on a host of genomic processes that influence the growth, development, and differentiation of the epithelial cells at the colon crypt surface, where the balance between proliferation and differentiation is maintained possibly through the Wnt (beta-catenin/T-cell factor) signaling pathway. A loss of balance caused by either genetic mutations or environmental factors such as dietary habits can modulate the risk for the formation of aberrant crypt foci and ultimately the development of colon cancer. Evidence exists that butyrate reduces the number and the size of aberrant crypt foci in the colon. Butyrate is a natural histone deacetylase inhibitor as well as a molecule involved with enhanced TGF-beta-induced SMAD3 phosphorylation, increased IFN-gamma-mediated apoptosis, and altered expression of the intestinal muc2 gene that is responsible for mucin synthesis. Other dietary components, such as vitamin D and (n-3) fatty acids, may regulate proliferative properties of colon progenitor cells as well as the differentiation of subcellular lineages. Although these findings are intriguing, there are uncertainties that remain to be resolved including the optimal exposure needed to bring about an effect, the appropriate timing of administration, and if nutrient-nutrient and nutrient-gene interactions determine the overall response. The expanded use of high-throughput technologies, knowledge about the expression of genes and protein fingerprints, and metabolomic profiling will assist in addressing these issues and ultimately in determining the physiological significance of bioactive food components as cancer protectants.",Colon_Cancer

"Surgical resection is the primary treatment for colon cancer. The introduction and acceptance of laparoscopic colectomy for cancer has been gradual for a number of reasons including the fact that it is technically challenging, has less than dramatic patient benefits, and perhaps most significantly it could theoretically represent a compromise as an oncologic procedure. Preliminary evidence suggests that laparoscopic colectomy for colon cancer is safe, feasible, and can be performed with acceptable operative times and conversion rates. Furthermore, it may offer important patient-related advantages and the same extent of resection as in open surgery can be achieved. It may result in improved outcomes when performed by experienced surgeons. The early experience with high rates of wound recurrences has not been realized in current reports. Ongoing prospective, randomized trials should establish whether laparoscopic colectomy is as effective as open colectomy in preventing recurrence and death from colon cancer; until then this procedure is not considered standard for patients with curable colon cancer.",Colon_Cancer

"A retrospective review of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who were seen between 1984 and 1996 at the Royal Marsden Hospital identified 40 patients with serum thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb). These antibodies can interfere with the immunoradiometric assay for serum thyroglobulin (Tg) used at this hospital, with resulting underestimation of the Tg level. A review of the case notes was carried out to ascertain the clinical significance of TgAb. The median follow-up from diagnosis of DTC was 26 months (range 3-401). The median age at diagnosis of DTC was 50 years (range 13-83). Patients were grouped according to the TgAb titre (high titre: TgAb >1/100, n = 28; low titre TgAb <1/100, n = 12). Thirteen patients relapsed, 11 in the high titre group and two in the low titre group. Sites of recurrence were: neck (n = 9), lung (n = 5), bone (n = 4) and brain (n = 2). No patient in the high titre group showed an elevated Tg with recurrence. One patient in the low titre group showed a Tg response to recurrence. Overall, the Tg assay failed to detect 92% of recurrences. Eight patients in the high titre group developed TgAb, apparently in response to tumour progression. In a third patient in the low titre group, the TgAb also acted as a 'tumour marker'. Thus, overall TgAb acted as a tumour marker in nine of the 40 (22.5%) patients in whom it was detected, and in nine of the 470 (1.9%) patients on follow-up during this time period. The overall survival of the whole group was 69% at 10 years. For patients with papillary carcinoma (n = 34) overall survival was 78% at 10 years. Laboratories should report routinely the presence of TgAb, with a caution indicating the direction of possible error (which depends on the assay used). Clinicians should appreciate that Tg measurements are unreliable in the presence of TgAb and that the development of TgAb can indicate active tumour.",Thyroid_Cancer
"TERT promoter mutations (TERT-p mutations) have been found in many types of cancer and have emerged to play critical roles in tumor progression. The mutations upregulate TERT transcription, and TERT not only elongates telomeres and confers unlimited proliferative capacity on tumor cells, but is also involved in tumor progression and aggressiveness. In differentiated thyroid carcinoma, TERT-p mutations are associated with a number of high-risk clinicopathological aggressiveness and worse prognosis, making it the best molecular marker to predict tumor aggressiveness so far. This review summarizes recent relevant findings regarding TERT-p mutations and their functional/mechanistic aspects.",Thyroid_Cancer

"Significant progress is being made in understanding molecular events leading to lung cancer. Both susceptibility factors (molecular markers of risk) and the genetic alterations involved have been discovered. New techniques for early detection of lung cancer based on molecular changes (i.e. mutations in p53, K-ras and rb, amplification of myc and Her-2/neu, deletion of 3p, and microsatellite instability) in sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid may be used as tools in diagnosis and prognosis, as well as in screening programs.

"The incidence of nodal metastasis in differentiated thyroid cancer ranges between 40% to 75%. Elective neck dissection is generally not advised in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer; however, if clinically apparent nodal disease is noted in the tracheoesophageal groove during surgery, central compartment clearance is advised. If clinically apparent nodal disease is present in the lateral compartment of the neck, modified neck dissection preserving the sternomastoid, accessory nerve, and jugular vein is advised. The ""berry picking procedure"" is generally not recommended because of the higher incidence of regional recurrence. Due consideration should be given for parathyroidal transplantation if the blood supply to the parathyroids is damaged during central compartment clearance. The incidence of lymph node metastasis is highest in young patients, however, lymph node metastasis has no bearing on long-term survival. There seems to be a higher incidence of regional recurrence in elderly individuals. If patients present with bulky nodal disease, consideration may be given for postoperative radioactive iodine dosimetry and ablation if necessary. Differentiated thyroid cancer represents a unique disease in the human body, where lymph node metastasis has no prognostic implication. Aggressive surgical clearance is advised in patients with medullary thyroid cancer in the central compartment and the jugular chain lymph nodes.",Thyroid_Cancer
"Colon cancer has been associated with several nutrients and foods. The authors used data from a population-based study conducted in Northern California, Utah, and Minnesota to examine associations between dietary eating patterns and risk of developing colon cancer. Through factor analysis, detailed dietary intake data obtained from 1,993 cases (diagnosed in 1991-1994) and 2,410 controls were grouped into factors that were evaluated for relations with lifestyle characteristics and colon cancer risk. Several dietary patterns emerged. The dietary patterns with the most variation were labeled ""Western,"" ""prudent,"" ""high fat/sugar dairy,"" ""substituters,"" and ""drinkers."" The ""Western"" dietary pattern was associated with a higher body mass index and a greater intake of total energy and dietary cholesterol. The ""prudent"" pattern was associated with higher levels of vigorous leisure time physical activity, smaller body size, and higher intakes of dietary fiber and folate. Persons who had high scores on the ""drinker"" pattern were also more likely to smoke cigarettes. The ""Western"" dietary pattern was associated with an increased risk of colon cancer in both men and women. The association was strongest among people diagnosed prior to age 67 years (for men, odds ratio (OR)=1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-3.15; for women, OR=2.02, 95% CI 1.21-3.36) and among men with distal tumors (OR=2.25, 95% CI 1.47-3.46). The ""prudent"" diet was protective, with the strongest associations being observed among people diagnosed prior to age 67 years (men: OR=0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92; women: OR=0.58, 95% CI 0.38-0.87); associations with this dietary pattern were also strong among persons with proximal tumors (men: OR=0.55, 95% CI 0.38-0.80; women: OR=0.64, 95% CI 0.45-0.92). Although ""substituters"" (people who substituted low fat dairy products for high fat dairy products, margarine for butter, poultry for red meat, and whole grains for refined grains) were at reduced risk of colon cancer, the reduction in risk was not statistically significant. These data support the hypothesis that overall dietary intake pattern is associated with colon cancer, and that the dietary pattern associated with the greatest increase in risk is the one which typifies a Western-style diet.",Colon_Cancer

"Allostery is a regulation at a distance by conveying information from one site to another and an intrinsic property of dynamic proteins. Allostery plays an essential role in receptor trafficking, signal transmission, controlled catalysis, gene turn on/off, or cell apoptosis. Allosteric mutations are considered as one of causes responsible for cancer development, leading to ""allosteric diseases"" by stabilizing an active or inactive conformation or changing the dynamic distribution of preexisting propagation pathways. The present article mainly focuses on the potential of allosteric therapies for lung cancer. Allosteric drugs may have several advantages over traditional drugs. The epidermal growth factor receptor mutations and signaling pathways downstream (such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways) were suggested to play a key role in lung cancer and considered as targets of allosteric therapy. Some allosteric inhibitors for lung cancer-specific targets and a series of preclinical trials of allosteric inhibitors for lung cancer have been developed and reported. We expect that allosteric therapies will gain more attentions to develop combinatorial strategies for lung cancer and metastasis.",Lung_Cancer
"The month of March is dedicated to Colon Cancer Awareness. Worldwide, colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence has been on the rise. It is currently the third most common cancer in men (746,000 cases, 10.0% of the total) and the second in women (614,000 cases, 9.2% of the total).1 Arecent meta-analysis reported a 61% risk reduction in CRC incidence with colonoscopy.2 Unlike screening programs for breast and prostate cancers, not only has CRC screening reduced mortality from colon cancer and detected early CRC, it has also decreased the incidence of CRC through detection and removal of pre-cancerous lesions. Studies have shown that screening for colorectal cancer provided 152 to 313 life-years-gained (LYG) per 1000 forty-year-old individuals.3 Anumber of modalities exist for CRC screening, which can broadly be categorized into stool-based tests and direct visualization tests. Stool-based tests include fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) and stool DNAtesting. Direct visualization tests include endoscopic procedures such as colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy; and radiographic tests such as CT colonography, which has largely replaced air contrast barium enemas.4 The only reported population-based data for CRC in Pakistan comes from Bhurgri et al. in 2011.5It described Pakistan as a low risk region with an age standardized incidence rate (ASR) world per 100,000 of 7.1 in males and 5.2 in females, but with a much younger age and advanced stage at diagnosis. The ratio for individuals diagnosed with CRC under the age of 40, as oppose to over 40 years, was 3:1, which is much higher than the international average. Noteworthy as well, is an increase in incidence especially among men, noted between the study periods of 1995-1997 and 1997-2002. It ranks 7th in incidence among males, and 8th among females, with tobacco related malignancies topping the list.6 There has since been additional cross-sectional data from Pakistan echoing these findings of a younger age and advanced disease at presentation.7 Speaking from a public health perspective, Pakistan, while still battling communicable diseases, is now seeing an increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases population-based screening programs for CRC were not justified in most developing countries, citing low reported incidence and low resource health authorities; but that in limited regions with an ageing population and a shift to Western lifestyle, organized screening strategies needed to be developed. This can well be extrapolated to large urban centers in Pakistan. In a resource poor, conservative country like Pakistan, with poor health literacy, there exist many barriers to CRC screening which were summed up very articulately by Ahmed F in 2013. Quite appropriately, areas identified for further pursuit included, among others, the training of gastroenterologists, especially female ones, less expensive and more culturally acceptable screening options, and cost-effectiveness analyses. The recipe for any cancer screening program to be successful, begins with epidemiological data to document disease burden. There has not been any population-based cancer registry to report incidence data for the past few years. There is also no centralized cancer registry to effectively unify and coordinate data from across the country. Furthermore, even with a cancer registry there is no mandated reporting of malignancies from a health policy standpoint, as exists in the more developed world. The last population-based data we have for CRC was for cases reported until 2002, and there was already an increase in incidence noted in less than a decade, starting in 1995.5 Health awareness is another important factor. There is no data from Pakistan regarding patient or physician awareness regarding colon cancer. If one is to extrapolate, a cross-sectional study on breast cancer awareness, for which Pakistan demonstrates one of the highest incidences worldwide,6 reported that a mammogram had been performed in only 4.9 % of women in the cohort, while 61.5 % of the remainder had never even heard about it.7 It is also unclear if we have the infrastructure including endoscopy centers and adequate numbers of gastroenterologists to service the population at large. FOBTis available and cheap, but there is no data regarding the availability of FITor stool DNAtesting. In the absence of health insurance, it will certainly be a challenge to make CRC screening widely accessible. At what point does a disease warrant attention? While we may not have the luxury or the immediate necessity to introduce mass population-based CRC screening, we can certainly start with individual screening in populations who are at high risk of colorectal cancer due to family history and have adequate access to healthcare. There should be a concerted drive to revitalize cancer registration in order to guide health policy and to have an effective national cancer control program. Awareness programs are also needed to be established for the public and, specifically, for physicians as well.",Colon_Cancer

"Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in the Western world. In spite of major advances in understanding the staging and prognostic factors of lung cancer, advances in survival have been minimal over the past 20 years. For patients with non-small cell carcinoma, surgical resection offers the only chance of meaningful survival. In contrast, for patients with small cell carcinoma, the sensitivity of this tumor type to cytotoxic therapy, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy, offers the only chance of long-term survival. However, it is clear that many factors in addition to stage of disease and performance status of the patient are important in predicting the prognosis for lung cancer. These factors include the biologic properties inherent in the tumor cells themselves.

"Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3, SLCO1B3) is normally expressed in hepatocytes. In this study, we showed frequent overexpression of OATP1B3 in colorectal adenocarcinomas. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis of 17 colon tumors indicated tumoral overexpression of OATP1B3 by approximately 100-fold, compared with 20 normal colon samples (P < 0.0001). Using immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray containing 93 evaluable colon tumor specimens, we detected immunostaining of OATP1B3 in 75 colon adenocarcinomas (81%) and no immunostaining in normal samples. To determine the functional effects of OATP1B3 expression on drug-induced apoptosis, we used camptothecin and oxaliplatin on a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines stably overexpressing OATP1B3. The results indicated that OATP1B3 overexpression enhanced cell survival in RKO, HCT-8, and HCT116(p53+/+) cells that harbor wild-type p53 but not in Caco-2 and HCT116(p53-/-) cells that lack p53, compared with the respective empty vector controls (P < 0.01). The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling assay confirmed that HCT116(p53+/+) cells overexpressing OATP1B3 had significantly lower apoptotic levels compared with empty vector control (P < 0.001). The overexpression of OATP1B3 reduced the transcriptional activity of p53, with subsequent reductions in transcript and protein levels of its downstream transcription targets (P21WAF1 and PUMA). Overexpression of a point mutation (G583E) variant of OATP1B3 lacking transport activity did not confer an antiapoptotic effect or affect p53 transcriptional activity, suggesting that the antiapoptotic effect of OATP1B3 may be associated with its transport activity. Taken together, our results suggest that OATP1B3 overexpression in colorectal cancer cells may provide a survival advantage by altering p53-dependent pathways.",Colon_Cancer

"The incidence of thyroid cancer was examined temporally and geographically by age and sex from data provided by tumor registries in the United States and abroad. The temporal trends in Connecticut showed an increase in annual incidence after 1945, with an especially sudden increase in incidence in females. The increase occurred predominantly in older males and younger females. The increase in young females was confirmed by cohort analysis. The rates rose with age in both sexes, but recently females have developed a secondary peak in the fourth decade of life. The same phenomenon was observed in other U.S. data but not as clearly in data from ten foreign registries.

"In Africa the incidence of lung cancer is rising rapidly. The purpose of this prospective study was to analyze clinical, therapeutic, and prognostic features of lung cancer patients treated at the Principal Hospital in Dakar between 2002 and 2007. A total of 72 cases were compiled over the 5-year study period. In 88% of cases the patient was a male smoker with a mean age of 59.2 years. Histological samples were obtained in 79.1% of cases by bronchial fibroscopy (n=33), CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy (n=17), or from a metastatic site (n=7). The histological diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma in 23 cases, adenocarcinoma in 14, large-cell carcinoma in 17, small-cell lung cancer in 2, and bronchiolo-alveolar cancer in 1. Tumor staging demonstrated grades I-II in 6 cases, grade II in 17, and grade IV in 49. Symptomatic management was performed in 68% of patients. In the remaining cases management consisted of chemotherapy in 22 cases, radiotherapy for pain relief in 5, and surgery in 1. Ten patients were lost from follow-up. Median survival was 7 or 3 months depending on whether or not chemotherapy was performed. The much higher rate of histological diagnosis than in the sub-region is due mainly to the availability of trained personnel with access to bronchial endoscopy and CT-scan needle biopsy since September 2003. Administration of cytotoxins is feasible but the cost is excessive due to the lack of universal health care coverage: two-thirds of cases were abandoned whereas chemotherapy significantly improved median survival by 4 months (p < 0.0001).

"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a crucial substrate for thyroid peroxidase, a key enzyme involved in thyroid hormone synthesis. However, as a potent oxidant, H2O2 might also be responsible for the high level of oxidative DNA damage observed in thyroid tissues, such as DNA base lesions and strand breakages, which promote chromosomal instability and contribute to the development of tumours. Although the role of H2O2 in thyroid hormone synthesis is well established, its precise mechanisms of action in pathological processes are still under investigation. The NADPH oxidase/dual oxidase family are the only oxidoreductases whose primary function is to produce reactive oxygen species. As such, the function and expression of these enzymes are tightly regulated. Thyrocytes express dual oxidase 2, which produces most of the H2O2 for thyroid hormone synthesis. Thyrocytes also express dual oxidase 1 and NADPH oxidase 4, but the roles of these enzymes are still unknown. Here, we review the structure, expression, localization and function of these enzymes.

"The number of lung cancer deaths in Japan has been continuously increasing for decades, mainly because of the growing size of the elderly population. In contrast, age-specific lung cancer death rates for those aged under 79 years plateaued recently, reflecting the decreasing smoking rates since 1966. However, the smoking rate for males (54% in 1999) is still extraordinarily high in Japan compared to other developed countries, so it is necessary to further promote anti-smoking activities. It is reported that the relative risk for lung cancer due to cigarette smoking increases 4-5 fold (current smokers versus non-smokers) for males and 2-3 fold for females, and that the population attributable risk is 70% for males and 15-25% for females in Japan, which indicates that cigarette smoking is the most influential risk factor for lung cancer. However, the magnitude of the relative risk and population attributable risk is not as high as those observed in other developed countries. In order to clarify the reasons for this, it is necessary to further accumulate findings from actual epidemiological studies in Japan. In addition to cigarette smoking, occupational exposures, dietary habits (low intake of vegetables and fruits), atmospheric air pollution, environmental tobacco smoke, cooking and heating fuels, indoor radon and previous lung diseases are reported to increase the risk of lung cancer.",Lung_Cancer
"Since the late 1980s, lung cancer incidence in men has declined in Germany whereas in women there is still a rise. There is no approved screening program for lung cancer up to now and results from randomized trials like the National Lung Screening Trial are eagerly awaited.

Patient selection for therapeutic use of bevacizumab is crucial to optimize safety. Ongoing trials explore multitargeted agents such as sorafenib, sunitinib, and vandetanib.",Lung_Cancer
"Medullary thyroid cancer is a rare neoplasm that arises from the parafollicular C cells. It occurs in a sporadic form, or less commonly as a hereditary form, as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes types 2A and 2B. The RET proto-oncogene is currently the primary factor that is implicated in the hereditary forms of this neoplasm. The knowledge about the genetic makeup of the neoplasm impacts upon management as it allows for screening, early detection, and prophylactic treatment. Surgery is the main modality that offers a cure. This entails a total thyroidectomy and vigilant management and surveillance of the neck. Prognosis of patients with MTC is variable, but the more constant factors that affect it are the stage of disease and the age of the patient. The emerging molecular genetic understanding of this malignancy will provide the foundation for prognostic and therapeutic decision-making in the future. Interdisciplinary management by surgeons, endocrinologists, pathologists, radiotherapists, radiologists, and medical oncologists should be sought.",Thyroid_Cancer
"There is a high frequency of hematopoietic abnormalities in patients with neoplastic disorders, anemia being one of the most common and important, especially in lung cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A number of factors are able to affect the incidence and severity of chemotherapy-induced anemia: the type of chemotherapy, chemotherapy dose-intensity, chemotherapy duration, prior treatment, baseline Hb value and entity of Hb decrease during chemotherapy. An impaired erythroid marrow response to erythropoietin (EPO) and reduced EPO levels in response to anemia may contribute to the development of this form of anemia in lung cancer patients. Recombinant human EPO has been successfully used in the treatment of anemia. EPO increases the red cells mass and eliminates by approximately 50% the need for blood transfusions in patients with chronic anemia of cancer. EPO is also effective in the prevention of anemia of cancer patients. Besides increasing the levels of hemoglobin, EPO is also able to significantly improve the quality of life and performance status of anemic patients with cancer. EPO is well tolerated and the only drawbacks are represented by its cost and the need for a prolonged parenteral treatment. The use of EPO can be optimized by taking into consideration some predicting factors, by modulating the dose and by using iron support. In patients with lung cancer, the objective of EPO treatment may vary from palliation to survival improvement according to stage, type of antineoplastic treatment and prognosis. To take maximum advantage from its efficacy, EPO treatment in lung cancer patients needs to be individualized by identifying for each patient the risk of severe anemia and the objective of treatment.",Lung_Cancer
"There is an emerging need for greater understanding of pharmacology principles among technical staff. Indeed, the responsibility of dose preparation and administration, under any level of supervision, demands a foundational understanding of pharmacology. This is true for radiopharmaceuticals, contrast media, and pharmaceutical interventions or adjunctive medications. Regulation around the same might suggest a need to embed pharmacology theory in undergraduate education programs, and there is a need to disseminate that same foundational understanding to practicing clinicians. Moreover, pharmacology foundations can provide a key understanding of the principles that underpin quantitative techniques (e.g., pharmacokinetics). This article is the first in a series that aims to enhance the understanding of pharmacologic principles relevant to nuclear medicine. This article will deal with the introductory concepts, terminology, and principles that underpin the concepts to be discussed in the remainder of the series. The second article will build on the pharmacodynamic principles examined in this article with a treatment of pharmacokinetics. Article 3 will outline pharmacology relevant to pharmaceutical interventions and adjunctive medications used in general nuclear medicine, article 4 will cover pharmacology relevant to pharmaceutical interventions and adjunctive medications used in nuclear cardiology, and article 5 will discuss the pharmacology related to contrast media associated with CT and MRI.

"Mu agonists have been an important component of pain treatment for thousands of years. The usual pharmacokinetic parameters (half-life, clearance, volume of distribution) of opioids have been known for some time. However, the metabolism has, until recently, been poorly understood, and there has been recent interest in the role of metabolites in modifying the pharmacodynamic response in patients, in both analgesia and adverse effects.

Advantages and disadvantages of various opioids in the management of chronic pain are discussed.",Generic
"Statins, inhibitors of the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase enzyme, are molecules of fungal origin. By inhibiting a key step in the sterol biosynthetic pathway statins are powerful cholesterol lowering medications and have provided outstanding contributions to the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Their detection in mycetes traces back to close to 40 years ago: there were, originally, widely opposing views on their therapeutic potential. From then on, intensive pharmaceutical development has led to the final availability in the clinic of seven statin molecules, characterized by differences in bioavailability, lipo/hydrophilicity, cytochrome P-450 mediated metabolism and cellular transport mechanisms. These differences are reflected in their relative power (mg LDL-cholesterol reduction per mg dose) and possibly in parenchymal or muscular toxicities. The impact of the antagonism of statins on a crucial step of intermediary metabolism leads, in fact, both to a reduction of cholesterol biosynthesis as well as to additional pharmacodynamic (so called ""pleiotropic"") effects. In the face of an extraordinary clinical success, the emergence of some side effects, e.g. raised incidence of diabetes and cataracts as well as frequent muscular side effects, have led to increasing concern by physicians. However, also in view of the present relatively low cost of these drugs, their impact on daily therapy of vascular patients is unlikely to change.",Generic
"H1-antihistamines, the mainstay of treatment for urticaria, were developed from anticholinergic drugs more than 70 years ago. They act as inverse agonists rather than antagonists of histamine H1-receptors which are members of the G-protein family. The older first generation H1-antihistamines penetrate readily into the brain to cause sedation, drowsiness, fatigue and impaired concentration and memory causing detrimental effects on learning and examination performance in children and on impairment of the ability of adults to work and drive. Their use should be discouraged. The newer second-generation H1-antihistamines are safer, cause less sedation and are more efficacious. Three drugs widely used for symptomatic relief in urticaria, desloratadine, levocetirizine and fexofenadine are highlighted in this review. Of these levocetirizine and fexofenadine are the most potent in humans in vivo. However, levocetirizine may cause somnolence in susceptible individuals, whereas fexofenadine has a relatively short duration of action and may be required to be given twice daily for all round daily protection. Although desloratadine is less potent, it has the advantages of rarely causing somnolence and having a long duration of action.",Generic

"CFTR protein is an ion channel regulated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation and expressed in many types of epithelial cells. CFTR-mediated chloride and bicarbonate secretion play an important role in the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Pharmacological modulators of CFTR represent promising drugs for a variety of diseases. In particular, correctors and potentiators may restore the activity of CFTR in cystic fibrosis patients. Potentiators are also potentially useful to improve mucociliary clearance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. On the other hand, CFTR inhibitors may be useful to block fluid and electrolyte loss in secretory diarrhea and slow down the progression of polycystic kidney disease.",Generic
"TMEM16 proteins, also known as anoctamins, are a family of ten membrane proteins with various tissue expression and subcellular localization. TMEM16A (anoctamin 1) is a plasma membrane protein that acts as a calcium-activated chloride channel. It is expressed in many types of epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells and some neurons. In airway epithelial cells, TMEM16A expression is particularly enhanced by inflammatory stimuli that also promote goblet cell metaplasia and mucus hypersecretion. Therefore, pharmacological modulation of TMEM16A could be beneficial to improve mucociliary clearance in chronic obstructive respiratory diseases. However, the correct approach to modulate TMEM16A activity (activation or inhibition) is still debated. Pharmacological inhibitors of TMEM16A could also be useful as anti-hypertensive agents given the TMEM16A role in smooth muscle contraction. In contrast to TMEM16A, TMEM16F (anoctamin 6) behaves as a calcium-activated phospholipid scramblase, responsible for the externalization of phosphatidylserine on cell surface. Inhibitors of TMEM16F could be useful as anti-coagulants and anti-viral agents. The role of other anoctamins as therapeutic targets is still unclear since their physiological role is still to be defined.",Generic
"There is little evidence for most of the medications currently used to treat functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs) in children. Not only are there very few clinical trials, but also most have significant variability in the methods used and outcomes measured. Thus, the decision on the most appropriate pharmacological treatment is frequently based on adult studies or empirical data. In children, peppermint oil, trimebutine, and drotaverine have shown significant benefit compared with placebo, each of them in a single randomized clinical trial. A small study found that cyproheptadine was beneficial in the treatment of FAPDs in children. There are conflicting data regarding amitriptyline. While one small study found a significant benefit in quality of life compared with placebo, a large multicenter study found no benefit compared with placebo. The antidepressant, citalopram, failed to meet the primary outcomes in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis. Rifaximin has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of adults with IBS. Those findings differ from studies in children where no benefit was found compared to placebo. To date, there are no placebo-controlled trials published on the use of linaclotide or lubiprostone in children. Alpha 2 delta ligands such as gabapentin and pregabalin are sometimes used in the care of this group of children, but no clinical trials are available in children with FAPDs. Similarly, novel drugs that have been approved for the care of irritable bowel with diarrhea in adults such as eluxadoline have yet to be studied in children.",Generic
"Aging involves changes in several physiologic processes that lead to decreased volumes of distribution, slowed metabolism, and increased end-organ sensitivity to anesthetics. These changes generally result in increased potency. Elderly patients require less anesthetic medication, but the true extent of reduction is underappreciated and less uniformly practiced. The impact of potential anesthetic drug overdosing on intermediate and long-term outcomes is not fully appreciated. It may be necessary to consider age as a continuous variable for anesthetic drug dosing in older patients rather than treating adult versus elderly patients. Further pharmacologic studies are required in people more than 85 years old.",Generic
"The chapter presents an argument supporting the view that taste, defined as the receptor-mediated signaling of taste cells and consequent sensory events, is proper subject matter for the field of pharmacology. The argument develops through a consideration of how the field of pharmacology itself is to be defined. Though its application toward the discovery and development of therapeutics is of obvious value, pharmacology nevertheless is a basic science committed to examining biological phenomena controlled by the selective interactions between chemicals - regardless of their sources or uses - and receptors. The basic science of pharmacology is founded on the theory of receptor occupancy, detailed here in the context of taste. The discussion then will turn to consideration of the measurement of human taste and how well the results agree with the predictions of receptor theory.",Generic

"Ophthalmic diseases include both those analogous to systemic diseases (eg, inflammation, infection, neuronal degeneration) and not analogous (eg, cataract, myopia). Many anterior segment diseases are treated pharmacologically through eye drops, which have an implied therapeutic index of local therapy. Unlike oral dosage forms administered for systemic diseases, eyedrops require patients not only to adhere to treatment, but to be able to accurately perform-ie, instill drops correctly. Anatomical and physiological barriers make topical delivery to the anterior chamber challenging-in some cases more challenging than absorption through the skin, nasal passages, or gut. Treatment of the posterior segment (eg, vitreous, retina, choroid, and optic nerve) is more challenging due to additional barriers. Recently, intravitreal injections have become a standard of care with biologics for the treatment of macular degeneration and other diseases. Although the eye has esterases, hydroxylases, and transporters, it has relatively little CYP450 enzymes. Because it is challenging to obtain drug concentrations at the target site, ocular clinical pharmacokinetics, and thus pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interactions, are rarely available. Ophthalmic pharmaceuticals require consideration of solubility, physiological pH, and osmolarity, as well as sterility and stability, which in turn requires optimal pharmaceutics. Although applied locally, ocular medications may be absorbed systemically, which results in morbidity and mortality (eg, systemic hypotension, bronchospasm, and bradycardia).",Generic
"The biological effects of the bisphosphonates (BPs) as inhibitors of calcification and bone resorption were first described in the late 1960s. In the 50 years that have elapsed since then, the BPs have become the leading drugs for the treatment of skeletal disorders characterized by increased bone resorption, including Paget's disease of bone, bone metastases, multiple myeloma, osteoporosis and several childhood inherited disorders. The discovery and development of the BPs as a major class of drugs for the treatment of bone diseases is a paradigm for the successful journey from ""bench to bedside and back again"". Several of the leading BPs achieved ""blockbuster"" status as branded drugs. However, these BPs have now come to the end of their patent life, making them highly affordable. The opportunity for new clinical applications for BPs also exists in other areas of medicine such as ageing, cardiovascular disease and radiation protection. Their use as inexpensive generic medicines is therefore likely to continue for many years to come. Fifty years of research into the pharmacology of bisphosphonates have led to a fairly good understanding about how these drugs work and how they can be used safely in patients with metabolic bone diseases. However, while we seemingly know much about these drugs, a number of key aspects related to BP distribution and action remain incompletely understood. This review summarizes the existing knowledge of the (pre)clinical and translational pharmacology of BPs, and highlights areas in which understanding is lacking.",Generic
"Mitochondria are being recognized as key factors in many unexpected areas of biomedical science. In addition to their well-known roles in oxidative phosphorylation and metabolism, it is now clear that mitochondria are also central to cell death, neoplasia, cell differentiation, the innate immune system, oxygen and hypoxia sensing, and calcium metabolism. Disruption to these processes contributes to a range of human pathologies, making mitochondria a potentially important, but currently seemingly neglected, therapeutic target. Mitochondrial dysfunction is often associated with oxidative damage, calcium dyshomeostasis, defective ATP synthesis, or induction of the permeability transition pore. Consequently, therapies designed to prevent these types of damage are beneficial and can be used to treat many diverse and apparently unrelated indications. Here we outline the biological properties that make mitochondria important determinants of health and disease, and describe the pharmacological strategies being developed to address mitochondrial dysfunction.",Generic

"Two of the main characteristics of western societies in the last fifty years have been the medicalization of the human life and the environmental degradation. The first one has forced human being to consider medicines use related to what would be rational, reasonable and well-reasoned. The second one brought us to a new ecologist conscience. In relation to the ""human social system"", the effects of medication can be considered very positive as a whole, particularly those related to the amazing increase of expectative and quality of life. But, along with those unquestionable beneficial effects, medicines have also caused some negative effects for other biotic and abiotic systems, such as microbian alterations and their undesirable consequences which have involved the massive use of antibiotics in medicine and veterinary, the uncontrolled elimination of millions of doses of all kind of drugs, additives and excipients, etc., as well as atmospheric contamination and degradation of forests and deep oceans which can have been caused by investigation and production of determinated drugs. In this context Pharmacology appears as a scientific discipline that studies the research (R), development (D), production (P), and utilization (U) of drugs and medical substances in relation to the environment. From a farmaecologic perspective the drugs utilization has its development in three main contexts, all of them closely related: prescription quality, farmaceutical care, and patient's active participation in his own disease and treatment.",Generic

"The main goal of this paper is to present the case for shifting the focus of research on aging and anti-aging from lifespan pharmacology to what I like to call healthspan pharmacology, in which the desired outcome is the extension of healthy years of life rather than lifespan alone. Lifespan could be influenced by both genetic and epigenetic factors, but a long lifespan may not be a good indicator of an optimal healthspan. Without improving healthspan, prolonging longevity would have enormous negative socioeconomic outcomes for humans. Therefore, the goal of aging and anti-aging research should be to add healthy years to life and not merely to increase the chronological age. This article summarizes and compares two categories of pharmacologically induced lifespan extension studies in animal model systems from the last two decades-those reporting the effects of pharmacological interventions on lifespan extension alone versus others that include their effects on both lifespan and healthspan in the analysis. The conclusion is that the extrapolation of pharmacological results from animal studies to humans is likely to be more relevant when both lifespan and healthspan extension properties of pharmacological intervention are taken into account.",Generic

"Despite clear evidence for a distinct amylin pharmacology and localization of such pharmacology to sites such as the nucleus accumbens,efforts to clone an amylin receptor were fruitless for over a decade. This enigma led many to doubt the status of amylin as a bona fide hormone. Yet it became apparent during those cloning efforts that, whatever the amylin receptor was, it was somehow similar to a calcitonin receptor. The enigma of the amylin receptor was solved following the identification of receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPs). These single transmembrane spanning molecules, when associated with a calcitonin receptor, altered its pharmacology from calcitonin-preferring to amylin-preferring. With at least two forms of the calcitonin receptor and three forms of RAMP, there is the potential for six subtypes of amylin receptors. Of these, two appear to predominate. The CTa (shorter form) calcitonin receptor, dimerized with RAMP1 [amylin 1 (a) receptor], appears to represent binding sites at the nucleus accumbens and the subfornical organ. Binding sites at area postrema appear to be composed of CTa + RAMP3 [amylin3 (a) receptors]. Thus far, RAMP proteins have been associated in vivo only with the CT/CLR receptor system. It is presently unknown whether RAMPs are more general modulators of receptor function, dynamically modifying responsivity with time or across other receptor classes. The largest and first identified amylin-binding field was in the nucleus accumbens. The function of these receptors is yet undetermined, but because the nucleus accumbens is within the blood-brain barrier, the cognate ligand is unlikely to be circulating amylin. Dense amylin binding is present at the circumventricular organs, including the subfornical organ, the organum vasculosum lateralis terminalis (OVLT), and the area postrema. There is no diffusional (blood-brain) barrier at these structures, so they most likely respond to circulating (beta-cell-derived) amylin. Despite pharmacological evidence of amylin sensitivity in several peripheral tissues, selective amylin binding outside of the brain is observed only in the renal cortex. The newly designated amylinomimetic drug class was defined on the basis of its unique pharmacology prior to the molecular characterization of amylin receptors. Currently, the class includes any agent that acts as antagonist at characterized amylin receptors. Several peptides, typically analogs of truncated salmon calcitonin, have been developed as potent and selective amylin antagonists and have been useful in identifying amylinergic responses. Of these, AC187 (30Asn32Tyr[8-32]sCT; Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc.) is particularly selective and potent, and has been most often cited in studies using amylin antagonists. Antagonism of a response with an order of potency of AC187> AC66 > CGRP[8-37] is suggestive that it is mediated via amylin receptors. Activation of a response with salmon calcitonin (sCT) > amylin >calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) > mammalian CT suggests activation via the amylinl (a) receptor, while sCT = amylin >> CGRP >mammalian CT suggests activation via amylin3 (a) receptors. Absence of response to other ligands (e.g., adrenomedullin) is useful for excluding certain pharmacologies.",Generic

"Application of sound ocular therapeutic principle is more difficult in food animals than most other species. Financial or husbandry constraints limit the practitioner's ability to use the entire range of ocular drugs available or to use them with adequate frequency.

By far the most important medically treatable eye disease encountered in food animal practice is IBK. Effective therapies include systemic administration of long-acting oxytetracycline, subconjunctival administration of a variety of antibiotics, or topical application of benzathine cloxacillin. Infectious conjunctivitis in sheep and goats due to a variety of agents may be treated successfully with tetracycline in most cases. Conjunctivitis and keratitis secondary to IBR virus usually are given supportive therapy only, although specific antiviral drugs have been used in the treatment of herpetic eye disease in other species.

"Etoposide, a podophyllotoxin derivative, has demonstrated antitumor efficacy in a number of human malignancies, including lymphomas, germinal tumors, and lung cancer (especially small cell). Etoposide's antineoplastic activity is achieved through DNA strand breakage, which likely results from the formation of a complex involving drug, DNA, and the DNA unwinding enzyme, topoisomerase II. The drug's steady state volume of distribution ranges from 5 to 17 L/m2, and it is highly bound to plasma protein with an average free plasma fraction of 6%. A number of etoposide metabolites have been confirmed or postulated. Several cell lines have been shown to acquire resistance to etoposide through membrane transport changes. Considerable intrapatient variability exists in pharmacokinetic parameters following intravenous (IV) and oral dosing. Approximately 30% to 40% of unchanged IV drug is excreted in the urine, whereas biliary excretion appears a minor route of drug elimination. The bioavailability of oral etoposide averages 50%, although wide variability exists both among and within different patients. Bioavailability decreases as the dose of oral etoposide is increased. Several recent studies have attempted to correlate etoposide plasma concentrations with toxicity (primarily myelosuppression) in hopes of using this information to optimize drug dosing.",Generic
"The pharmacology of the cannabinoids is characterized by at least two very provocative phenomena. First, the multiplicity of effects. As I have mentioned throughout this review, most of these effects are due to actions on the central nervous system. The major problem in the search for a therapeutic agent in this series has been due to the inability to find a cannabinoid with the therapeutic action at doses below those that produce side effects. The high lipid solubility of the cannabinoids allows them to be distributed throughout the brain at reasonable doses. The second aspect of their pharmacology worthy of special mention is their low toxicity. Throughout this review, I have indicated that the minimal effective dose of delta 9-THC for a particular pharmacological effect in animals was higher than that usually consumed by man. Yet, in almost all cases, it was much lower than the dose which produced toxic effects in the same species. These two characteristics of the animal pharmacology of cannabinoids carry over to humans. For instance, each of the cannabinoids tested in man causes many side effects at active doses and lethal effects of overdose by humans are nonexistent or rare. Toxicity following chronic use may be a different issue. A great deal of work has been carried out in an attempt to characterize the pharmacological effects of cannabinoids. It is clear from the material reviewed in this article that most if not all of the predominant effects of cannabinoids in whole animals are due to the direct effects of these compounds on the central nervous system. Our state of knowledge is too limited to rule out the possibility that they also produce effects on certain peripheral organs. It is expected that the majority of these effects will be shown to be due to the interaction of the cannabinoids with the neuronal innervation of the organ rather than directly with the organ tissue itself. Very high doses of cannabinoids just like all active drugs have an effect on many organ systems. These are toxicologic not pharmacologic and are nonspecific. The effects of cannabinoids at the molecular level have been reviewed by Martin (182a) in this series. This type of research is expected to elucidate the mechanism of action of cannabinoids at the cellular level. It is clear that the cannabinoids produce a unique behavioral syndrome in laboratory animals and in man.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Generic
"Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) is an emerging field of modeling technologies that describes the dynamic interaction between biological systems and drugs. Recently, QSP is increasingly being applied to pharmaceutical drug discovery and development, and used for various types of decision makings. In contrast to empirical and statistical models, QSP represents complex systems of human physiology by integrating comprehensive biological information, hence, it can address various purposes including target and/or disease-related biomarker identification, hypothesis testing, and prediction of clinical efficacy or toxicity. On the other hand, structures of QSP models become quite complicated with huge amount of biological components, therefore, close collaboration between pharmacologists having profound knowledge of biology and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) scientists, experts of model building, is crucial for QSP development and implementation. This article introduces, from DMPK scientists to pharmacologists, main features of QSP and its applications in pharmaceutical industries, and discusses challenges and future perspectives for effective utilization in drug discovery and development.",Generic
"Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) has emerged as a powerful ensemble of approaches aiming at developing integrated mathematical and computational models elucidating the complex interactions between pharmacology, physiology, and disease. As the field grows and matures its applications expand beyond the boundaries of research and development and slowly enter the decision making and regulatory arenas. However, widespread acceptance and eventual adoption of a new modeling approach requires assessment criteria and quantifiable metrics that establish credibility and increase confidence in model predictions. QSP aims to provide an integrated understanding of pathology in the context of therapeutic interventions. Because of its ambitious nature and the fact that QSP emerged in an uncoordinated manner as a result of activities distributed across organizations and academic institutions, high entropy characterizes the tools, methods, and computational methodologies and approaches used. The eventual acceptance of QSP model predictions as supporting material for an application to a regulatory agency will require that two key aspects are considered: (1) increase confidence in the QSP framework, which drives standardization and assessment; and (2) careful articulation of the expectations. Both rely heavily on our ability to rigorously and consistently assess QSP models. In this manuscript, we wish to discuss the meaning and purpose of such an assessment in the context of QSP model development and elaborate on the differentiating features of QSP that render such an endeavor challenging. We argue that QSP establishes a conceptual, integrative framework rather than a specific and well-defined computational methodology. QSP elicits the use of a wide variety of modeling and computational methodologies optimized with respect to specific applications and available data modalities, which exceed the data structures employed by chemometrics and PK/PD models. While the range of options fosters creativity and promises to substantially advance our ability to design pharmaceutical interventions rationally and optimally, our expectations of QSP models need to be clearly articulated and agreed on, with assessment emphasizing the scope of QSP studies rather than the methods used. Nevertheless, QSP should not be considered an independent approach, rather one of many in the broader continuum of computational models.",Generic
"Validation of a quantitative model is a critical step in establishing confidence in the model's suitability for whatever analysis it was designed. While processes for validation are well-established in the statistical sciences, the field of quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) has taken a more piecemeal approach to defining and demonstrating validation. Although classical statistical methods can be used in a QSP context, proper validation of a mechanistic systems model requires a more nuanced approach to what precisely is being validated, and what role said validation plays in the larger context of the analysis. In this review, we summarize current thoughts of QSP validation in the scientific community, contrast the aims of statistical validation from several contexts (including inference, pharmacometrics analysis, and machine learning) with the challenges faced in QSP analysis, and use examples from published QSP models to define different stages or levels of validation, any of which may be sufficient depending on the context at hand.",Generic
"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic requires the rapid development of efficacious treatments for patients with life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models are mathematical representations of pathophysiology for simulating and predicting the effects of existing or putative therapies. The application of model-based approaches, including QSP, have accelerated the development of some novel therapeutics. Nevertheless, the development of disease-scale mechanistic models can be a slow process, often taking years to be validated and considered mature. Furthermore, emerging data may make any QSP model quickly obsolete. We present a prototype QSP model to facilitate further development by the scientific community. The model accounts for the interactions between viral dynamics, the major host immune response mediators and tissue damage and regeneration. The immune response is determined by viral activation of innate and adaptive immune processes that regulate viral clearance and cell damage. The prototype model captures two physiologically relevant outcomes following infection: a ""healthy"" immune response that appropriately defends against the virus, and an uncontrolled alveolar inflammatory response that is characteristic of acute respiratory distress syndrome. We aim to significantly shorten the typical QSP model development and validation timeline by encouraging community use, testing, and refinement of this prototype model. It is our expectation that the model will be further advanced in an open science approach (i.e., by multiple contributions toward a validated quantitative platform in an open forum), with the ultimate goal of informing and accelerating the development of safe and effective treatment options for patients.",Generic

Our results call attention to the need for an aligned definition and consistent terminology around QSP, yet highlight the broad applicability and benefits preclinical QSP modeling is currently delivering.",Generic
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly metastatic breast cancer subtype, has limited treatment options. While a small number of patients attain clinical benefit with single-agent checkpoint inhibitors, identifying these patients before the therapy remains challenging. Here, we developed a transcriptome-informed quantitative systems pharmacology model of metastatic TNBC by integrating heterogenous metastatic tumors. In silico clinical trial with an anti-PD-1 drug, pembrolizumab, predicted that several features, such as the density of antigen-presenting cells, the fraction of cytotoxic T cells in lymph nodes, and the richness of cancer clones in tumors, could serve individually as biomarkers but had a higher predictive power as combinations of two biomarkers. We showed that PD-1 inhibition neither consistently enhanced all antitumorigenic factors nor suppressed all protumorigenic factors but ultimately reduced the tumor carrying capacity. Collectively, our predictions suggest several candidate biomarkers that might effectively predict the response to pembrolizumab monotherapy and potential therapeutic targets to develop treatment strategies for metastatic TNBC.",Generic
"Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) is experiencing increased application in the drug discovery and development process. Like its older sibling, systems biology, the QSP field is comprised of a mix of established disciplines and methods, from molecular biology to engineering to pharmacometrics. As a result, there exist critical segments of the discipline that differ dramatically in approach and a need to bring these groups together toward a common goal.",Generic
"Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling is applied to address essential questions in drug development, such as the mechanism of action of a therapeutic agent and the progression of disease. Meanwhile, machine learning (ML) approaches also contribute to answering these questions via the analysis of multi-layer 'omics' data such as gene expression, proteomics, metabolomics, and high-throughput imaging. Furthermore, ML approaches can also be applied to aspects of QSP modeling. Both approaches are powerful tools and there is considerable interest in integrating QSP modeling and ML. So far, a few successful implementations have been carried out from which we have learned about how each approach can overcome unique limitations of the other. The QSP + ML working group of the International Society of Pharmacometrics QSP Special Interest Group was convened in September, 2019 to identify and begin realizing new opportunities in QSP and ML integration. The working group, which comprises 21 members representing 18 academic and industry organizations, has identified four categories of current research activity which will be described herein together with case studies of applications to drug development decision making. The working group also concluded that the integration of QSP and ML is still in its early stages of moving from evaluating available technical tools to building case studies. This paper reports on this fast-moving field and serves as a foundation for future codification of best practices.",Generic
"Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) modeling is increasingly applied in the pharmaceutical industry to influence decision making across a wide range of stages from early discovery to clinical development to post-marketing activities. Development of standards for how these models are constructed, assessed, and communicated is of active interest to the modeling community and regulators but is complicated by the wide variability in the structures and intended uses of the underlying models and the diverse expertise of QSP modelers. With this in mind, the IQ Consortium conducted a survey across the pharmaceutical/biotech industry to understand current practices for QSP modeling. This article presents the survey results and provides insights into current practices and methods used by QSP practitioners based on model type and the intended use at various stages of drug development. The survey also highlights key areas for future development including better integration with statistical methods, standardization of approaches towards virtual populations, and increased use of QSP models for late-stage clinical development and regulatory submissions.",Generic
"Current computational and mathematical tools are demonstrating the high value of using systems modeling approaches (e.g. Quantitative Systems Pharmacology) to understand the effect of a given compound on the biological and physiological mechanisms related to a specific disease. This review provides a short survey of the evolution of the mathematical approaches used to understand the effect of particular cholesterol-lowering drugs, from pharmaco-kinetic (PK) / pharmaco-dynamic (PD) models, through physiologically base pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) to QSP. These mathematical models introduce more mechanistic information related to the effect of these drugs on atherosclerosis progression and demonstrate how QSP could open new ways for stratified medicine in this field.",Generic
"Significant events have taken place shaping the recent industrialization of physiologically based pharmacokinetic in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (PBPK-IVIVE) use in drug development. Due to our knowledge gaps about drug-independent systems parameters, there are limitations in the use of purely IVIVE-based (bottom-up) approaches. This has encouraged combining the classical data analysis (top-down) with PBPK-IVIVE-linked models in order to optimize model parameters by taking advantage of observed clinical data. This concept, when initiated after clinical observations, can be viewed as ""reverse translation,"" since it refers back to available systems information preclinical data before trying to describe the observations. This review demonstrates the advantages of such strategies in filling knowledge gaps and discusses the perceived hurdles in widening applications. It is paramount that no clinical data are assessed on their own, but in conjunction with other studies for that drug in different populations and/or other similar drugs in the same population.",Generic
"Good eyesight belongs to the most-valued attributes of health, and diseases of the eye are a significant healthcare burden. Case numbers are expected to further increase in the next decades due to an aging society. The development of drugs in ophthalmology, however, is difficult due to limited accessibility of the eye, in terms of drug administration and in terms of sampling of tissues for drug pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics (PDs). Ocular quantitative systems pharmacology models provide the opportunity to describe the distribution of drugs in the eye as well as the resulting drug-response in specific segments of the eye. In particular, ocular physiologically-based PK (PBPK) models are necessary to describe drug concentration levels in different regions of the eye. Further, ocular effect models using molecular data from specific cellular systems are needed to develop dose-response correlations. We here describe the current status of PK/PBPK as well as PD models for the eyes and discuss cellular systems, data repositories, as well as animal models in ophthalmology. The application of the various concepts is highlighted for the development of new treatments for postoperative fibrosis after glaucoma surgery.",Generic
"Immunotherapy has shown great potential in the treatment of cancer; however, only a fraction of patients respond to treatment, and many experience autoimmune-related side effects. The pharmaceutical industry has relied on mathematical models to study the behavior of candidate drugs and more recently, complex, whole-body, quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models have become increasingly popular for discovery and development. QSP modeling has the potential to discover novel predictive biomarkers as well as test the efficacy of treatment plans and combination therapies through virtual clinical trials. In this work, we present a QSP modeling platform for immuno-oncology (IO) that incorporates detailed mechanisms for important immune interactions. This modular platform allows for the construction of QSP models of IO with varying degrees of complexity based on the research questions. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the platform through two example applications of immune checkpoint therapy.",Generic
"A next generation multiscale quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model for antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) is presented, for preclinical to clinical translation of ADC efficacy. Two HER2 ADCs (trastuzumab-DM1 and trastuzumab-DXd) were used for model development, calibration, and validation. The model integrates drug specific experimental data including in vitro cellular disposition data, pharmacokinetic (PK) and tumor growth inhibition (TGI) data for T-DM1 and T-DXd, as well as system specific data such as properties of HER2, tumor growth rates, and volumes. The model incorporates mechanistic detail at the intracellular level, to account for different mechanisms of ADC processing and payload release. It describes the disposition of the ADC, antibody, and payload inside and outside of the tumor, including binding to off-tumor, on-target sinks. The resulting multiscale PK model predicts plasma and tumor concentrations of ADC and payload. Tumor payload concentrations predicted by the model were linked to a TGI model and used to describe responses following ADC administration to xenograft mice. The model was translated to humans and virtual clinical trial simulations were performed that successfully predicted progression free survival response for T-DM1 and T-DXd for the treatment of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer, including differential efficacy based upon HER2 expression status. In conclusion, the presented model is a step toward a platform QSP model and strategy for ADCs, integrating multiple types of data and knowledge to predict ADC efficacy. The model has potential application to facilitate ADC design, lead candidate selection, and clinical dosing schedule optimization.",Generic
"Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) has emerged as a promising modeling and simulation (M&S) approach in drug development, with potential to improve clinical success rates. While conventional M&S has significantly contributed to quantitative understanding in late preclinical and clinical phases, it falls short in explaining unexpected phenomena and testing hypotheses in the early research phase. QSP presents a solution to these limitations. To harness the full potential of QSP in early preclinical stages, preclinical modelers who are familiar with conventional M&S need to update their understanding of the differences between conventional M&S and QSP. This review focuses on QSP applications during the preclinical stage, citing case examples and sharing our experiences in oncology. We emphasize the critical role of QSP in increasing the probability of success for clinical proof of concept (PoC) when applied from the early preclinical stage. Enhancing the quality of both hypotheses and QSP models from early preclinical stage is of critical importance. Once a QSP model achieves credibility, it facilitates predictions of clinical responses and potential biomarkers. We propose that sequential QSP applications from preclinical stages can improve success rates of clinical PoC, and emphasize the importance of refining both hypotheses and QSP models throughout the process.",Generic
"XmAb24306 is a lymphoproliferative interleukin (IL)-15/IL-15 receptor (IL-15R ) Fc-fusion protein currently under clinical investigation as an immunotherapeutic agent for cancer treatment. XmAb24306 contains mutations in IL-15 that attenuate its affinity to the heterodimeric IL-15 receptor (IL-15R). We observe substantially prolonged pharmacokinetics (PK) (half-life 2.5 to 4.5 days) in single- and repeat-dose cynomolgus monkey (cyno) studies compared to wild-type IL-15 (half-life 1 hour), leading to increased exposure and enhanced and durable expansion of NK cells, CD8+ T cells and CD4-CD8- (double negative [DN]) T cells. Drug clearance varied with dose level and time post-dose, and PK exposure decreased upon repeated dosing, which we attribute to increased target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) resulting from drug-induced lymphocyte expansion (i.e., pharmacodynamic (PD)-enhanced TMDD). We developed a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model to quantify the complex PKPD behaviors due to the interactions of XmAb24306 with multiple cell types (CD8+, CD4+, DN T cells, and NK cells) in the peripheral blood (PB) and lymphoid tissues. The model, which includes nonspecific drug clearance, binding to and TMDD by IL15R differentially expressed on lymphocyte subsets, and resultant lymphocyte margination/migration out of PB, expansion in lymphoid tissues, and redistribution to the blood, successfully describes the systemic PK and lymphocyte kinetics observed in the cyno studies. Results suggest that after 3 doses of every-two-week (Q2W) doses up to 70 days, the relative contributions of each elimination pathway to XmAb24306 clearance are: DN T cells > NK cells > CD8+ T cells > nonspecific clearance > CD4+ T cells. Modeling suggests that observed cellular expansion in blood results from the influx of cells expanded by the drug in lymphoid tissues. The model is used to predict lymphoid tissue expansion and to simulate PK-PD for different dose regimens. Thus, the model provides insight into the mechanisms underlying the observed PK-PD behavior of an engineered cytokine and can serve as a framework for the rapid integration and analysis of data that emerges from ongoing clinical studies in cancer patients as single-agent or given in combination.",Generic
"Typical Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) workflows involve discussion of biology, supported by graphical diagrams, followed by construction of large Ordinary Differential Equation models.

"Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) models capture the physiological underpinnings driving the response to a drug and express those in a semi-mechanistic way, often involving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The process of developing a QSP model generally starts with the definition of a set of reasonable hypotheses that would support a mechanistic interpretation of the expected response which are used to form a network of interacting elements. This is a hypothesis-driven and knowledge-driven approach, relying on prior information about the structure of the network. However, with recent advances in our ability to generate large datasets rapidly, often in a hypothesis-neutral manner, the opportunity emerges to explore data-driven approaches to establish the network topologies and models in a robust, repeatable manner. In this paper, we explore the possibility of developing complex network representations of physiological responses to pharmaceuticals using a logic-based analysis of available data and then convert the logic relations to dynamic ODE-based models. We discuss an integrated pipeline for converting data to QSP models. This pipeline includes using k-means clustering to binarize continuous data, inferring likely network relationships using a Best-Fit Extension method to create a Boolean network, and finally converting the Boolean network to a continuous ODE model. We utilized an existing QSP model for the dual-affinity re-targeting antibody flotetuzumab to demonstrate the robustness of the process. Key output variables from the QSP model were used to generate a continuous data set for use in the pipeline. This dataset was used to reconstruct a possible model. This reconstruction had no false-positive relationships, and the output of each of the species was similar to that of the original QSP model. This demonstrates the ability to accurately infer relationships in a hypothesis-neutral manner without prior knowledge of a system using this pipeline.",Generic
"Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models and quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models have contributed to drug development strategies. The parameters of these models are commonly estimated by capturing observed values using the nonlinear least-squares method. Software packages for PBPK and QSP modeling provide a range of parameter estimation algorithms. To choose the most appropriate method, modelers need to understand the basic concept of each approach. This review provides a general introduction to the key points of parameter estimation with a focus on the PBPK and QSP models, and the respective parameter estimation algorithms. The latter part assesses the performance of five parameter estimation algorithms - the quasi-Newton method, Nelder-Mead method, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and Cluster Gauss-Newton method - using three examples of PBPK and QSP modeling. The assessment revealed that some parameter estimation results were significantly influenced by the initial values. Moreover, the choice of algorithms demonstrating good estimation results heavily depends on factors such as model structure and the parameters to be estimated. To obtain credible parameter estimation results, it is advisable to conduct multiple rounds of parameter estimation under different conditions, employing various estimation algorithms.",Generic
"Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) models provide a means of integrating knowledge into a quantitative framework and, ideally, this integration leads to a better understanding of biology and better predictions of new experiments and clinical trials.

"Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling has become increasingly important in pharmaceutical research and development, and is a powerful tool to gain mechanistic insights into the complex dynamics of biological systems in response to drug treatment. However, even once a suitable mathematical framework to describe the pathophysiology and mechanisms of interest is established, final model calibration and the exploration of variability can be challenging and time consuming. QSP models are often formulated as multi-scale, multi-compartment nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations. Commonly accepted modeling strategies, workflows, and tools have promise to greatly improve the efficiency of QSP methods and improve productivity. In this paper, we present the QSP Toolbox, a set of functions, structure array conventions, and class definitions that computationally implement critical elements of QSP workflows including data integration, model calibration, and variability exploration. We present the application of the toolbox to an ordinary differential equations-based model for antibody drug conjugates. As opposed to a single stepwise reference model calibration, the toolbox also facilitates simultaneous parameter optimization and variation across multiple in vitro, in vivo, and clinical assays to more comprehensively generate alternate mechanistic hypotheses that are in quantitative agreement with available data. The toolbox also includes scripts for developing and applying virtual populations to mechanistic exploration of biomarkers and efficacy. We anticipate that the QSP Toolbox will be a useful resource that will facilitate implementation, evaluation, and sharing of new methodologies in a common framework that will greatly benefit the community.",Generic
"2023 marks the 10th anniversary of Natpara's submission to the US FDA, which led to the first recorded regulatory interaction where a decision was supported by Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology (QSP) simulations. It had taken about 5 years for the timid QSP discipline to emerge as an effective Model-Informed Drug Development (MIDD) tool with visible impact in the pharmaceutical industry. Since then, the presence of QSP in the regulatory environment has continued to increase, to the point that the Agency reported 60 QSP submissions in 2020 alone, representing ~ 4% of their annual IND submissions [1]. What sort of industry mindset has enabled QSP to reach this level of success? How does QSP fit within the MIDD paradigm? Does QSP mean the same to Discovery and to Clinical Development projects? How do 'platforms' compare to 'fit-for-purpose' QSP models in an industrial setting? Can QSP and empirical Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic (PKPD) modelling be complementary? What level of validation is required to inform drug development decisions? This article reflects on all these questions, in particular addressing those audiences with limited line-of-sight into the drug industry decision-making machinery.",Generic
"Dose optimization of sirolimus may further improve outcomes in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients receiving post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Sirolimus exposure-response association studies in HCT patients (i.e., the association of trough concentration with clinical outcomes) have been conflicting. Sirolimus has important effects on T-cells, including conventional (Tcons) and regulatory T-cells (Tregs), both of which have been implicated in the mechanisms by which PTCy prevents GVHD, but there is an absence of validated biomarkers of sirolimus effects on these cell subsets. Considering the paucity of existing biomarkers and the complexities of the immune system, we conducted a literature review to inform a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model of GVHD. The published literature presented multiple challenges. The sirolimus pharmacokinetic models insufficiently describe sirolimus distribution to relevant physiological compartments. Despite multiple publications describing sirolimus effects on Tcons and Tregs in preclinical and human ex vivo models, consistent parameters relating sirolimus concentrations to circulating Tcons and Tregs could not be found. Each aspect presents a challenge in building a QSP model of sirolimus and its temporal effects on T-cell subsets and GVHD prevention. To optimize GVHD prevention regimens, phase I studies and systematic studies of immunosuppressant concentration-effect association are needed for QSP modeling.",Generic
"Quorum sensing (QS) has attracted great attention due to its important role in the bacterial interactions and its relevance to water management. With the development of high-throughput sequencing technology, a specific database for QS-related sequence annotation is urgently needed. Here, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles for 38 types of QS-related proteins were built using a total of 4024 collected seed sequences. Based on both homolog search and keywords confirmation against the non-redundant database, we established a QS-related protein (QSP) database, that includes 809,721 protein sequences and 186,133 nucleotide sequences, downloaded available at: https://github.com/chunxiao-dcx/QSP. The entries were classified into 38 types and 315 subtypes among 91 bacterial phyla. Furthermore, an automatic annotation pipeline, named QSAP, was developed for rapid annotation, classification and abundance quantification of QSP-like sequences from sequencing data. This pipeline provided the two homolog alignment strategies offered by Diamond (Blastp) or HMMER (Hmmscan), as well as a data cleansing function for a subset or union set of the hits. The pipeline was tested using 14 metagenomic samples from various water environments, including activated sludge, deep-sea sediments, estuary water, and reservoir water. The QSAP pipeline is freely available for academic use in the code repository at: https://github.com/chunxiao-dcx/QSAP. The establishment of this database and pipeline, provides a useful tool for QS-related sequence annotation in a wide range of projects, and will increase our understanding of QS communication in aquatic environments.",Generic
"Virtual patients (VPs) are widely used within quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling to explore the impact of variability and uncertainty on clinical responses. In one method of generating VPs, parameters are sampled randomly from a distribution, and possible VPs are accepted or rejected based on constraints on model output behavior. This approach works but can be inefficient (i.e., the vast majority of model runs typically do not result in valid VPs). Machine learning surrogate models offer an opportunity to improve the efficiency of VP creation significantly. In this approach, surrogate models are trained using the full QSP model and subsequently used to rapidly pre-screen for parameter combinations that result in feasible VPs. The overwhelming majority of parameter combinations pre-vetted using the surrogate models result in valid VPs when tested in the original QSP model. This tutorial presents this novel workflow and demonstrates how a surrogate model software application can be used to select and optimize the surrogate models in a case study. We then discuss the relative efficiency of the methods and scalability of the proposed method.",Generic
"The yeast-like fungi Pneumocystis, resides in lung alveoli and can cause a lethal infection known as Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in hosts with impaired immune systems. Current therapies for PCP, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), suffer from significant treatment failures and a multitude of serious side effects. Novel therapeutic approaches (i.e. newly developed drugs or novel combinations of available drugs) are needed to treat this potentially lethal opportunistic infection. Quantitative Systems Pharmacological (QSP) models promise to aid in the development of novel therapies by integrating available pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) knowledge to predict the effects of new treatment regimens.",Generic
"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a widely prevalent disease, but approved pharmaceutical treatments are not available. As such, there is great activity within the pharmaceutical industry to accelerate drug development in this area and improve the quality of life and reduce mortality for NASH patients. The use of quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) can help make this overall process more efficient. This mechanism-based mathematical modeling approach describes both the pathophysiology of a disease and how pharmacological interventions can modify pathophysiologic mechanisms. Multiple capabilities are provided by QSP modeling, including the use of model predictions to optimize clinical studies. The use of this approach has grown over the last 20 years, motivating discussions between modelers and regulators to agree upon methodologic standards. These include model transparency, documentation, and inclusion of clinical pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Several QSP models have been developed that describe NASH pathophysiology to varying extents. One specific application of NAFLDsym, a QSP model of NASH, is described in this manuscript. Simulations were performed to help understand if patient behaviors could help explain the relatively high rate of fibrosis stage reductions in placebo cohorts. Simulated food intake and body weight fluctuated periodically over time. The relatively slow turnover of liver collagen allowed persistent reductions in predicted fibrosis stage despite return to baseline for liver fat, plasma ALT, and the NAFLD activity score. Mechanistic insights such as this that have been derived from QSP models can help expedite the development of safe and effective treatments for NASH patients.",Generic
"Immunotherapy, by enhancing the endogenous anti-tumor immune responses, is showing promising results for the treatment of numerous cancers refractory to conventional therapies. However, its effectiveness for advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer remains unsatisfactory and new therapeutic strategies need to be developed. To this end, systems pharmacology modeling provides a quantitative framework to test in silico the efficacy of new treatments and combination therapies. In this paper we present a new Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) model of prostate cancer immunotherapy, calibrated using data from pre-clinical experiments in prostate cancer mouse models. We developed the model by using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) describing the tumor, key components of the immune system, and seven treatments. Numerous combination therapies were evaluated considering both the degree of tumor inhibition and the predicted synergistic effects, integrated into a decision tree. Our simulations predicted cancer vaccine combined with immune checkpoint blockade as the most effective dual-drug combination immunotherapy for subjects treated with androgen-deprivation therapy that developed resistance. Overall, the model presented here serves as a computational framework to support drug development, by generating hypotheses that can be tested experimentally in pre-clinical models.",Generic
"Generating realistic virtual patients from a limited amount of patient data is one of the major challenges for quantitative systems pharmacology modeling in immuno-oncology. Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) is a mathematical modeling methodology that integrates mechanistic knowledge of biological systems to investigate dynamics in a whole system during disease progression and drug treatment. In the present analysis, we parameterized our previously published QSP model of the cancer-immunity cycle to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and generated a virtual patient cohort to predict clinical response to PD-L1 inhibition in NSCLC. The virtual patient generation was guided by immunogenomic data from iAtlas portal and population pharmacokinetic data of durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor. With virtual patients generated following the immunogenomic data distribution, our model predicted a response rate of 18.6% (95% bootstrap confidence interval: 13.3-24.2%) and identified CD8/Treg ratio as a potential predictive biomarker in addition to PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden. We demonstrated that omics data served as a reliable resource for virtual patient generation techniques in immuno-oncology using QSP models.",Generic

"Warfarin dosing remains challenging due to substantial inter-individual variability, which can lead to unsafe or ineffective therapy with standard dosing. Model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) can help individualize warfarin dosing, requiring the selection of a suitable model. For models developed from clinical data, the dependence on the study design and population raises questions about generalizability. Quantitative system pharmacology (QSP) models promise better extrapolation abilities; however, their complexity and lack of validation on clinical data raise questions about applicability in MIPD. We have previously derived a mechanistic warfarin/international normalized ratio (INR) model from a blood coagulation QSP model. In this article, we evaluated the predictive performance of the warfarin/INR model in the context of MIPD using an external dataset with INR data from patients starting warfarin treatment. We assessed the accuracy and precision of model predictions, benchmarked against an empirically based reference model. Additionally, we evaluated covariate contributions and assessed the predictive performance separately in the more challenging outpatient data. The warfarin/INR model performed comparably to the reference model across various measures despite not being calibrated with warfarin initiation data. Including CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1 genotypes as covariates improved the prediction quality of the warfarin/INR model, even after assimilating 4 days of INR data. The outpatient INR exhibited higher unexplained variability, and predictions slightly exceeded observed values, suggesting that model adjustments might be necessary when transitioning from an inpatient to an outpatient setting. Overall, this research underscores the potential of QSP-derived models for MIPD, offering a complementary approach to empirical model development.",Generic
"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and dual GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonists improve glycaemic control and cause significant weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes.<sup>1</sup> These effects are driven in part by augmenting glucose-stimulated insulin release (incretin effect), reducing caloric intake and delayed gastric emptying. We developed and externally validated a novel integrated quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model to gain quantitative insight into the relative contributions and mechanisms of drugs modulating glucose regulatory pathways. This model (4GI model) incorporates known feedback mechanisms among glucose, GLP-1, glucagon, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), and insulin after glucose provocation (i.e., food intake) and drug intervention utilizing published nonpharmacological and pharmacological (liraglutide, a GLP-1RA) data. The resulting model accurately describes the aforementioned mechanisms and independently predicts the effects of the GLP-1RAs (dulaglutide and semaglutide) on system dynamics. Therefore, the validated 4GI model represents a quantitative decision-making tool to support the advancement of novel therapeutics and combination strategies modulating these pathways.",Generic
"Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models are often implemented using a wide variety of technical workflows and methodologies. To facilitate reproducibility, transparency, portability, and reuse for QSP models, we have developed gQSPSim, a graphical user interface-based MATLAB application that performs key steps in QSP model development and analyses. The capabilities of gQSPSim include (i) model calibration using global and local optimization methods, (ii) development of virtual subjects to explore variability and uncertainty in the represented biology, and (iii) simulations of virtual populations for different interventions. gQSPSim works with SimBiology-built models using components such as species, doses, variants, and rules. All functionalities are equipped with an interactive visualization interface and the ability to generate presentation-ready figures. In addition, standardized gQSPSim sessions can be shared and saved for future extension and reuse. In this work, we demonstrate gQSPSim's capabilities with a standard target-mediated drug disposition model and a published model of anti-proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) treatment of hypercholesterolemia.",Generic
"T cells have been recognized as core effectors for cancer immunotherapy. How to restore the anti-tumor ability of suppressed T cells or improve the lethality of cytotoxic T cells has become the main focus in immunotherapy. Bispecific antibodies, especially bispecific T cell engagers (TCEs), have shown their unique ability to enhance the patient's immune response to tumors by stimulating T cell activation and cytokine production in an MHC-independent manner. Antibodies targeting the checkpoint inhibitory molecules such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic lymphocyte activated antigen 4 are able to restore the cytotoxic effect of immune suppressed T cells and have also shown durable responses in patients with malignancies. However, both types have their own limitations in treating certain cancers. Preclinical and clinical results have emphasized the potential of combining these two antibodies to improve tumor response and patients' survival. However, the selection and evaluation of combination partners clinically is a costly endeavor. In addition, despite advances made in immunotherapy, there are subsets of patients who are non-responders, and reliable biomarkers for different immunotherapies are urgently needed to improve the ability to prospectively predict patients' response and improve clinical study design. Therefore, mathematical and computational models are essential to optimize patient benefit, and guide combination approaches with lower cost and in a faster manner.",Generic
"Integrating quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) into pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PKPD) has resulted in models that are highly complex and often not amenable to further exploration via estimation or design. Because QSP models are usually depicted using nonlinear differential equations it is not straightforward to apply some model reduction techniques, such as proper lumping. In this study, we explore the combined use of linearization and proper lumping as a general method to simplification of a nonlinear QSP model. We illustrate this with a bone biology model and the reduced model was then applied to describe bone mineral density (BMD) changes due to denosumab dosing. The methodologies used in this study can be applied to other multiscale models for developing a mechanism-based structural model for future analyses.",Generic
"Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models are increasingly used in drug development to provide a deep understanding of the mechanism of action of drugs and to identify appropriate disease targets. Such models are, however, not suitable for estimation purposes due to their high dimensionality. Based on any desired and specific input-output relationship, the system may be reduced to a model with fewer states and parameters. However, any simplification process will be a trade-off between model performance and complexity. In this study, we develop a weighted composite criterion which brings together the opposing indices of performance and dimensionality. The weighting factor can be determined by qualification of the simplified model based on a visual predictive check (VPC) using the precision of each parameter. The weighted criterion and model qualification techniques were illustrated with three examples: a simple compartmental pharmacokinetic model, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) example, and a semimechanistic model for bone mineral density. When considering the PBPK example, this automated search identified the same reduced model which had been detected in a previous report, as well as a simpler model which had not been previously identified. The simpler bone mineral density model provided an adequate description of the response even after 1 year from the initiation of treatment. The proposed criterion together with a VPC provides a natural way for model order reduction that can be fully automated and applied to multiscale models.",Generic
"While anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 [anti-PD-(L)1] monotherapies are effective treatments for many types of cancer, high variability in patient responses is observed in clinical trials. Understanding the sources of response variability can help prospectively identify potential responsive patient populations. Preclinical data may offer insights to this point and, in combination with modeling, may be predictive of sources of variability and their impact on efficacy. Herein, a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model of anti-PD-(L)1 was developed to account for the known pharmacokinetic properties of anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies, their impact on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and influx into the tumor microenvironment, and subsequent anti-tumor effects in CT26 tumor syngeneic mouse model. The QSP model was sufficient to describe the variability inherent in the anti-tumor responses post anti-PD-(L)1 treatments. Local sensitivity analysis identified tumor cell proliferation rate, PD-1 expression on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, and the binding affinity of PD-1:PD-L1 as strong influencers of tumor growth. It also suggested that treatment-mediated tumor growth inhibition is sensitive to T cell properties including the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation half-life, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell half-life, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated tumor cell killing rate, and maximum rate of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell influx into the tumor microenvironment. Each of these parameters alone could not predict anti-PD-(L)1 treatment response but they could shift an individual mouse's treatment response when perturbed. The presented preclinical QSP modeling framework provides a path to incorporate potential sources of response variability in human translation modeling of anti-PD-(L)1.",Generic
"Over the past decade, several immunotherapies have been approved for the treatment of melanoma. The most prominent of these are the immune checkpoint inhibitors, which are antibodies that block the inhibitory effects on the immune system by checkpoint receptors, such as CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1. Preclinically, blocking these receptors has led to increased activation and proliferation of effector cells following stimulation and antigen recognition, and subsequently, more effective elimination of cancer cells. Translation from preclinical to clinical outcomes in solid tumors has shown the existence of a wide diversity of individual patient responses, linked to several patient-specific parameters. We developed a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model that looks at the mentioned checkpoint blockade therapies administered as mono-, combo- and sequential therapies, to show how different combinations of specific patient parameters defined within physiological ranges distinguish different types of virtual patient responders to these therapies for melanoma. Further validation by fitting and subsequent simulations of virtual clinical trials mimicking actual patient trials demonstrated that the model can capture a wide variety of tumor dynamics that are observed in the clinic and can predict median clinical responses. Our aim here is to present a QSP model for combination immunotherapy specific to melanoma.",Generic

"A quantitative systems pharmacology model for metastatic melanoma was developed for immuno-oncology with the goal of predicting efficacy of combination checkpoint therapy with pembrolizumab and ipilimumab. This literature-based model is developed at multiple scales: (i) tumor and immune cell interactions at a lesion level; (ii) multiple heterogeneous target lesions, nontarget lesion growth, and appearance of new metastatic lesion at a patient level; and (iii) interpatient differences at a population level. The model was calibrated to pembrolizumab and ipilimumab monotherapy in patients with melanoma from Robert et al., specifically, waterfall plot showing target lesion response and overall response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1), which additionally considers nontarget lesion growth and appearance of new metastatic lesions. We then used the model to predict waterfall and RECIST version 1.1 for combination treatment reported in Long et al. A key insight from this work was that nontarget lesions growth and appearance of new metastatic lesion contributed significantly to disease progression, despite reduction in target lesions. Further, the lesion level simulations of combination therapy show substantial efficacy in warm lesions (intermediary immunogenicity) but limited advantage of combination in both cold and hot lesions (low and high immunogenicity). Because many patients with metastatic disease are expected to have a mixture of these lesions, disease progression in such patients may be driven by a subset of cold lesions that are unresponsive to checkpoint inhibitors. These patients may benefit more from the combinations which include therapies to target cold lesions than double checkpoint inhibitors.",Generic

"The task of image generation started receiving some attention from artists and designers, providing inspiration for new creations. However, exploiting the results of deep generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks can be long and tedious given the lack of existing tools. In this work, we propose a simple strategy to inspire creators with new generations learned from a dataset of their choice, while providing some control over the output. We design a simple optimization method to find the optimal latent parameters corresponding to the closest generation to any input inspirational image. Specifically, we allow the generation given an inspirational image of the user's choosing by performing several optimization steps to recover optimal parameters from the model's latent space. We tested several exploration methods from classical gradient descents to gradient-free optimizers. Many gradient-free optimizers just need comparisons (better/worse than another image), so they can even be used without numerical criterion nor inspirational image, only with human preferences. Thus, by iterating on one's preferences we can make robust facial composite or fashion generation algorithms. Our results on four datasets of faces, fashion images, and textures show that satisfactory images are effectively retrieved in most cases.",Generic
"Medical image data is critically important for a range of disciplines, including medical image perception research, clinician training programs, and computer vision algorithms, among many other applications. Authentic medical image data, unfortunately, is relatively scarce for many of these uses. Because of this, researchers often collect their own data in nearby hospitals, which limits the generalizabilty of the data and findings. Moreover, even when larger datasets become available, they are of limited use because of the necessary data processing procedures such as de-identification, labeling, and categorizing, which requires significant time and effort. Thus, in some applications, including behavioral experiments on medical image perception, researchers have used naive artificial medical images (e.g., shapes or textures that are not realistic). These artificial medical images are easy to generate and manipulate, but the lack of authenticity inevitably raises questions about the applicability of the research to clinical practice. Recently, with the great progress in Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), authentic images can be generated with high quality. In this paper, we propose to use GAN to generate authentic medical images for medical imaging studies. We also adopt a controllable method to manipulate the generated image attributes such that these images can satisfy any arbitrary experimenter goals, tasks, or stimulus settings. We have tested the proposed method on various medical image modalities, including mammogram, MRI, CT, and skin cancer images. The generated authentic medical images verify the success of the proposed method. The model and generated images could be employed in any medical image perception research.",Generic
"This article presents a new text-to-image (T2I) generation model, named distribution regularization generative adversarial network (DR-GAN), to generate images from text descriptions from improved distribution learning. In DR-GAN, we introduce two novel modules: a semantic disentangling module (SDM) and a distribution normalization module (DNM). SDM combines the spatial self-attention mechanism (SSAM) and a new semantic disentangling loss (SDL) to help the generator distill key semantic information for the image generation. DNM uses a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to normalize and denoise the image latent distribution, which can help the discriminator better distinguish synthesized images from real images. DNM also adopts a distribution adversarial loss (DAL) to guide the generator to align with normalized real image distributions in the latent space. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrated that our DR-GAN achieved a competitive performance in the T2I task.

"This paper introduces a novel convolution method, called generative convolution (GConv), which is simple yet effective for improving the generative adversarial network (GAN) performance. Unlike the standard convolution, GConv first selects useful kernels compatible with the given latent vector, and then linearly combines the selected kernels to make latent-specific kernels. Using the latent-specific kernels, the proposed method produces the latent-specific features which encourage the generator to produce high-quality images. This approach is simple but surprisingly effective. First, the GAN performance is significantly improved with a little additional hardware cost. Second, GConv can be employed to the existing state-of-the-art generators without modifying the network architecture. To reveal the superiority of GConv, this paper provides extensive experiments using various standard datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, LSUN-Church, CelebA, and tiny-ImageNet. Quantitative evaluations prove that GConv significantly boosts the performances of the unconditional and conditional GANs in terms of Frechet inception distance (FID) and Inception score (IS). For example, the proposed method improves both FID and IS scores on the tiny-ImageNet dataset from 35.13 to 29.76 and 20.23 to 22.64, respectively.",Generic
"In medical imaging, CycleGAN has been used for various image generation tasks, including image synthesis, image denoising, and data augmentation. However, when pushing the technical limits of medical imaging, there can be a substantial variation in image quality. Here, we demonstrate that images generated by CycleGAN can be improved through explicit grading of image quality, which we call stratified CycleGAN. In this image generation task, CycleGAN is used to upgrade the image quality and content of near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) retinal images. After manual assignment of grading scores to a small subset of the data, semi-supervised learning is applied to propagate grades across the remainder of the data and set up the training data. These scores are embedded into the CycleGAN by adding the grading score as a conditional input to the generator and by integrating an image quality classifier into the discriminator. We validate the efficacy of the proposed stratified CycleGAN by considering pairs of NIRF images at the same retinal regions (imaged with and without correction of optical aberrations achieved using adaptive optics), with the goal being to restore image quality in aberrated images such that cellular-level detail can be obtained. Overall, stratified CycleGAN generated higher quality synthetic images than traditional CycleGAN. Evaluation of cell detection accuracy confirmed that synthetic images were faithful to ground truth images of the same cells. Across this challenging dataset, F1-score improved from 76.9 5.7% when using traditional CycleGAN to 85.0 3.4% when using stratified CycleGAN. These findings demonstrate the potential of stratified Cycle-GAN to improve the synthesis of medical images that exhibit a graded variation in image quality.",Generic

"A realistic image generation method for visualisation in endoscopic simulation systems is proposed in this study. Endoscopic diagnosis and treatment are performed in many hospitals. To reduce complications related to endoscope insertions, endoscopic simulation systems are used for training or rehearsal of endoscope insertions. However, current simulation systems generate non-realistic virtual endoscopic images. To improve the value of the simulation systems, improvement of the reality of their generated images is necessary. The authors propose a realistic image generation method for endoscopic simulation systems. Virtual endoscopic images are generated by using a volume rendering method from a CT volume of a patient. They improve the reality of the virtual endoscopic images using a virtual-to-real image-domain translation technique. The image-domain translator is implemented as a fully convolutional network (FCN). They train the FCN by minimising a cycle consistency loss function. The FCN is trained using unpaired virtual and real endoscopic images. To obtain high-quality image-domain translation results, they perform an image cleansing to the real endoscopic image set. They tested to use the shallow U-Net, U-Net, deep U-Net, and U-Net having residual units as the image-domain translator. The deep U-Net and U-Net having residual units generated quite realistic images.",Generic
"Background and ObjectivesOver the last decade, Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized data analysis in many areas, including medical imaging. However, there is a bottleneck in the advancement of DL in the surgery field, which can be seen in a shortage of large-scale data, which in turn may be attributed to the lack of a structured and standardized methodology for storing and analyzing surgical images in clinical centres. Furthermore, accurate annotations manually added are expensive and time consuming. A great help can come from the synthesis of artificial images; in this context, in the latest years, the use of Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs) achieved promising results in obtaining photo-realistic images. MethodsIn this study, a method for Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) image synthesis is proposed. To this aim, the generative adversarial network pix2pix is trained to generate paired annotated MIS images by transforming rough segmentation of surgical instruments and tissues into realistic images. An additional regularization term was added to the original optimization problem, in order to enhance realism of surgical tools with respect to the background. Results Quantitative and qualitative (i.e., human-based) evaluations of generated images have been carried out in order to assess the effectiveness of the method. ConclusionsExperimental results show that the proposed method is actually able to translate MIS segmentations to realistic MIS images, which can in turn be used to augment existing data sets and help at overcoming the lack of useful images; this allows physicians and algorithms to take advantage from new annotated instances for their training.",Generic
"In the recent past, deep learning-based models have achieved tremendous success in computer vision-related tasks with the help of large-scale annotated datasets. An interesting application of deep learning is synthetic data generation, especially in the domain of medical image analysis. The need for such a task arises due to the scarcity of original data. Class imbalance is another reason for applying data augmentation techniques. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are beneficial for synthetic image generation in various fields. However, stand-alone GANs may only fetch the localized features in the latent representation of an image, whereas combining different GANs might understand the distributed features. To this end, we have proposed AGGrGAN, an aggregation of three base GAN models-two variants of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) to generate synthetic MRI scans of brain tumors. Further, we have applied the style transfer technique to enhance the image resemblance. Our proposed model efficiently overcomes the limitation of data unavailability and can understand the information variance in multiple representations of the raw images. We have conducted all the experiments on the two publicly available datasets - the brain tumor dataset and the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) 2020 dataset. Results show that the proposed model can generate fine-quality images with maximum Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) scores of 0.57 and 0.83 on the said two datasets.",Generic

"Semantic segmentation of histopathology images can be a vital aspect of computer-aided diagnosis, and deep learning models have been effectively applied to this task with varying levels of success. However, their impact has been limited due to the small size of fully annotated datasets. Data augmentation is one avenue to address this limitation. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown promise in this respect, but previous work has focused mostly on classification tasks applied to MR and CT images, both of which have lower resolution and scale than histopathology images. There is limited research that applies GANs as a data augmentation approach for large-scale image semantic segmentation, which requires high-quality image-mask pairs. In this work, we propose a multi-scale conditional GAN for high-resolution, large-scale histopathology image generation and segmentation. Our model consists of a pyramid of GAN structures, each responsible for generating and segmenting images at a different scale. Using semantic masks, the generative component of our model is able to synthesize histopathology images that are visually realistic. We demonstrate that these synthesized images along with their masks can be used to boost segmentation performance, especially in the semi-supervised scenario.",Generic
"The research topic of sketch-to-portrait generation has witnessed a boost of progress with deep learning techniques.

"Image generation from natural language has become a very promising area of research on multimodal learning in recent years. In recent years, the performance of this theme has improved rapidly, and the release of powerful tools has caused a great response in various places. The Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN) model is a representative method to generate images from text descriptions. Although it can generate high-resolution images, it involves several limitations; some of the images generated are typically unintelligible, and mode collapse may occur. Therefore, in this study, we aim to solve these two problems to generate images that follow a given text description more closely. First, we incorporate a new consistency regularization technique for conditional generation tasks into StackGAN, called Improved Consistency Regularization or ICR. The ICR technique learns the meaning of data by matching the semantic information of input data before and after data augmentation, and can also stabilize learning in adversarial networks. In this research, this method mainly suppresses mode collapse by expanding the variation of generated images. However, this method may lead to excessive variations in the generated images, which may result in images that do not match the meaning of the input text or that are ambiguous. Therefore, we further propose a new regularization method called ICCR as a modification of ICR, which is designed to perform conditional generation tasks and eliminate the negative impacts of the generator. This method realized the generation of various images along the input text. The proposed StackGAN with ICCR performed 16% better than StackGAN and 4% better than StackGAN with ICR and AttnGAN on the Inception Score using the CUB dataset. AttnGAN, similar to StackGAN, is a GAN-based text-to-image model that incorporates the attention mechanism, which has achieved great results in recent years. It is very important that our proposed model, which incorporates ICCR into a simple model, obtained better results than AttnGAN. In addition, StackGAN with ICCR was effective in eliminating mode collapse. The probability of mode collapse in the original StackGAN was 20%, while in StackGAN with ICCR the probability was 0%. In the questionnaire survey, our proposed method was rated 18% higher than StackGAN with ICR. This indicates that ICCR is more effective for conditional tasks than ICR.",Generic

"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are one of the most powerful generative models, but always require a large and balanced dataset to train. Traditional GANs are not applicable to generate minority-class images in a highly imbalanced dataset.

In this work, we propose a supervised autoencoder with an intermediate embedding model to disperse the labeled latent vectors. With the enhanced autoencoder initialization, we also build an architecture of BAGAN with gradient penalty (BAGAN-GP). Our proposed model overcomes the unstable issue in original BAGAN and converges faster to high-quality generations.

"Quantum annealing was originally proposed as an approach for solving combinatorial optimization problems using quantum effects. D-Wave Systems has released a production model of quantum annealing hardware. However, the inherent noise and various environmental factors in the hardware hamper the determination of optimal solutions. In addition, the freezing effect in regions with weak quantum fluctuations generates outputs approximately following a Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution at an extremely low temperature. Thus, a quantum annealer may also serve as a fast sampler for the Ising spin-glass problem, and several studies have investigated Boltzmann machine learning using a quantum annealer. Previous developments have focused on comparing the performance in the standard distance of the resulting distributions between conventional methods in classical computers and sampling by a quantum annealer. In this study, we focused on the performance of a quantum annealer as a generative model from a different aspect. To evaluate its performance, we prepared a discriminator given by a neural network trained on an a priori dataset. The evaluation results show a higher performance of quantum annealer compared with the classical approach for Boltzmann machine learning in training of the generative model. However the generation of the data suffers from the remanent quantum fluctuation in the quantum annealer. The quality of the generated images from the quantum annealer gets worse than the ideal case of the quantum annealing and the classical Monte-Carlo sampling.",Generic

In this paper, we introduce an interpretability approach for VQA models by generating counterfactual images. Specifically, the generated image is supposed to have the minimal possible change to the original image and leads the VQA model to give a different answer. In addition, our approach ensures that the generated image is realistic. Since quantitative metrics cannot be employed to evaluate the interpretability of the model, we carried out a user study to assess different aspects of our approach. In addition to interpreting the result of VQA models on single images, the obtained results and the discussion provides an extensive explanation of VQA models' behaviour.",Generic

"The existing face image recognition algorithm can accurately identify underexposed facial images, but the abuse of face image recognition technology can associate face features with personally identifiable information, resulting in privacy disclosure of the users. The paper puts forward a method for private face image generation based on deidentification under low light. First of all, the light enhancement and attenuation networks are pretrained using the training set, and low-light face images in the test set are input into the light enhancement network for photo enhancement. Then the facial area is captured by the face interception network, and corresponding latent code will be created through the latent code generation network and feature disentanglement will be done. Tiny noise will be added to the latent code by the face generation network to create deidentified face images which will be input in a light attenuation network to generate private facial images in a low-lighting style. At last, experiments show that, compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, this method is more successful in generating low-light private face images with the most similar structure to original photos. It protects users' privacy effectively by reducing the accuracy of the face recognition network, while also ensuring the practicability of the images.",Generic

"The lack of large datasets and high-quality annotated data often limits the development of accurate and robust machine-learning models within the medical and surgical domains. In the machine learning community, generative models have recently demonstrated that it is possible to produce novel and diverse synthetic images that closely resemble reality while controlling their content with various types of annotations. However, generative models have not been yet fully explored in the surgical domain, partially due to the lack of large datasets and due to specific challenges present in the surgical domain such as the large anatomical diversity. We propose Surgery-GAN, a novel generative model that produces synthetic images from segmentation maps. Our architecture produces surgical images with improved quality when compared to early generative models thanks to the combination of channel- and pixel-level normalization layers that boost image quality while granting adherence to the input segmentation map. While state-of-the-art generative models often generate overfitted images, lacking diversity, or containing unrealistic artefacts such as cartooning; experiments demonstrate that Surgery-GAN is able to generate novel, realistic, and diverse surgical images in three different surgical datasets: cholecystectomy, partial nephrectomy, and radical prostatectomy. In addition, we investigate whether the use of synthetic images together with real ones can be used to improve the performance of other machine-learning models. Specifically, we use Surgery-GAN to generate large synthetic datasets which we then use to train five different segmentation models. Results demonstrate that using our synthetic images always improves the mean segmentation performance with respect to only using real images. For example, when considering radical prostatectomy, we can boost the mean segmentation performance by up to 5.43%. More interestingly, experimental results indicate that the performance improvement is larger in the set of classes that are under-represented in the training sets, where the performance boost of specific classes reaches up to 61.6%.",Generic

"In this paper, we tackle the problem of pose-guided person image generation with unpaired data, which is a challenging problem due to non-rigid spatial deformation. Instead of learning a fixed mapping directly between human bodies as previous methods, we propose a new pathway to decompose a single fixed mapping into two subtasks, namely, semantic parsing transformation and appearance generation. First, to simplify the learning for non-rigid deformation, a semantic generative network is developed to transform semantic parsing maps between different poses. Second, guided by semantic parsing maps, we render the foreground and background image, respectively. A foreground generative network learns to synthesize semantic-aware textures, and another background generative network learns to predict missing background regions caused by pose changes. Third, we enable pseudo-label training with unpaired data, and demonstrate that end-to-end training of the overall network further refines the semantic map prediction and final results accordingly. Moreover, our method is generalizable to other person image generation tasks defined on semantic maps, e.g., clothing texture transfer, controlled image manipulation, and virtual try-on. Experimental results on DeepFashion and Market-1501 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, especially in keeping better body shapes and clothing attributes, as well as rendering structure-coherent backgrounds.",Generic

The primary challenge is generating a plausible image and controlling the high degree of freedom involved in generating a wide area that includes all directions. We focus on scene symmetry, which is a basic property of the global structure of spherical images, such as the rotational and plane symmetries. We propose a method for generating a spherical image from a few NFOV images and controlling the generated regions using scene symmetry. We incorporate the intensity of the symmetry as a latent variable into conditional variational autoencoders to estimate the possible range of symmetry and decode a spherical image whose features are represented through a combination of symmetric transformations of the NFOV image features. Our experiments show that the proposed method can generate various plausible spherical images controlled from asymmetrically to symmetrically, and can reduce the reconstruction errors of the generated images based on the estimated symmetry.",Generic
"The occlusal surfaces of natural teeth have complex features of functional pits and fissures. These morphological features directly affect the occlusal state of the upper and lower teeth. An image generation technology for functional occlusal pits and fissures is proposed to address the lack of local detailed crown surface features in existing dental restoration methods. First, tooth depth image datasets were constructed using an orthogonal projection method. Second, the optimization and improvement of the model parameters were guided by introducing the jaw position spatial constraint, the L1 loss and the perceptual loss functions. Finally, two image quality evaluation metrics were applied to evaluate the quality of the generated images, and deform the dental crown by using the generated occlusal pits and fissures as constraints to compare with expert data. The results showed that the images generated using the network constructed in this study had high quality, and the detailed pit and fissure features on the crown were effectively restored, with a standard deviation of 0.1802mm compared to the expert-designed tooth crown models.",Generic
"In this paper, a modified encoder-decoder structured fully convolutional network (ED-FCN) is proposed to generate the camera-like color image from the light detection and ranging (LiDAR) reflection image. Previously, we showed the possibility to generate a color image from a heterogeneous source using the asymmetric ED-FCN. In addition, modified ED-FCNs, i.e., UNET and selected connection UNET (SC-UNET), have been successfully applied to the biomedical image segmentation and concealed-object detection for military purposes, respectively. In this paper, we apply the SC-UNET to generate a color image from a heterogeneous image. Various connections between encoder and decoder are analyzed. The LiDAR reflection image has only 5.28% valid values, i.e., its data are extremely sparse. The severe sparseness of the reflection image limits the generation performance when the UNET is applied directly to this heterogeneous image generation. In this paper, we present a methodology of network connection in SC-UNET that considers the sparseness of each level in the encoder network and the similarity between the same levels of encoder and decoder networks. The simulation results show that the proposed SC-UNET with the connection between encoder and decoder at two lowest levels yields improvements of 3.87 dB and 0.17 in peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity, respectively, over the conventional asymmetric ED-FCN. The methodology presented in this paper would be a powerful tool for generating data from heterogeneous sources.",Generic
"Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in medical imaging continue facing the difficulty in collecting and using large datasets. One method proposed for solving this problem is data augmentation using fictitious images generated by generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, applying a GAN as a data augmentation technique has not been explored, owing to the quality and diversity of the generated images. To promote such applications by generating diverse images, this study aims to generate free-form lesion images from tumor sketches using a pix2pix-based model, which is an image-to-image translation model derived from GAN. As pix2pix, which assumes one-to-one image generation, is unsuitable for data augmentation, we propose StylePix2pix, which is independently improved to allow one-to-many image generation. The proposed model introduces a mapping network and style blocks from StyleGAN. Image generation results based on 20 tumor sketches created by a physician demonstrated that the proposed method can reproduce tumors with complex shapes. Additionally, the one-to-many image generation of StylePix2pix suggests effectiveness in data-augmentation applications.",Generic
"Being able to cover a wide range of views, pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras have been widely deployed in visual surveillance systems. To achieve a global-view perception of a surveillance scene, it is necessary to generate its panoramic background image, which can be used for the subsequent applications such as road segmentation, active tracking, and so on. However, few works have been reported on this problem, partially due to the lack of benchmark dataset and the high complexity of panoramic image generation of PTZ cameras. In this paper, we build, for the first time to our best knowledge, a benchmark PTZ camera dataset with multiple views, and derive a complete set of panoramic transformation formulas for PTZ cameras. We further propose a fast multi-band blending method to address the efficiency issue in panoramic image fusion and mosaicing. Some related panoramic transformations are also developed, such as cylindrical and overlooking transformations. Our proposed approach exhibits impressive accuracy and efficiency in PTZ panorama generation as well as panoramic image mosaicing.",Generic

"Railway defects can result in substantial economic and human losses. Among all defects, surface defects are the most common and prominent type, and various optical-based non-destructive testing (NDT) methods have been employed to detect them. In NDT, reliable and accurate interpretation of test data is vital for effective defect detection. Among the many sources of errors, human errors are the most unpredictable and frequent. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to address this challenge; however, the lack of sufficient railway images with diverse types of defects is the major obstacle to training the AI models through supervised learning. To overcome this obstacle, this research proposes the RailGAN model, which enhances the basic CycleGAN model by introducing a pre-sampling stage for railway tracks. Two pre-sampling techniques are tested for the RailGAN model: image-filtration, and U-Net. By applying both techniques to 20 real-time railway images, it is demonstrated that U-Net produces more consistent results in image segmentation across all images and is less affected by the pixel intensity values of the railway track. Comparison of the RailGAN model with U-Net and the original CycleGAN model on real-time railway images reveals that the original CycleGAN model generates defects in the irrelevant background, while the RailGAN model produces synthetic defect patterns exclusively on the railway surface. The artificial images generated by the RailGAN model closely resemble real cracks on railway tracks and are suitable for training neural-network-based defect identification algorithms. The effectiveness of the RailGAN model can be evaluated by training a defect identification algorithm with the generated dataset and applying it to real defect images. The proposed RailGAN model has the potential to improve the accuracy of NDT for railway defects, which can ultimately lead to increased safety and reduced economic losses. The method is currently performed offline, but further study is planned to achieve real-time defect detection in the future.",Generic
"Recent advances in computer vision have shown promising results in image generation. Diffusion probabilistic models have generated realistic images from textual input, as demonstrated by DALL-E 2, Imagen, and Stable Diffusion. However, their use in medicine, where imaging data typically comprises three-dimensional volumes, has not been systematically evaluated. Synthetic images may play a crucial role in privacy-preserving artificial intelligence and can also be used to augment small datasets. We show that diffusion probabilistic models can synthesize high-quality medical data for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). For quantitative evaluation, two radiologists rated the quality of the synthesized images regarding ""realistic image appearance"", ""anatomical correctness"", and ""consistency between slices"". Furthermore, we demonstrate that synthetic images can be used in self-supervised pre-training and improve the performance of breast segmentation models when data is scarce (Dice scores, 0.91 [without synthetic data], 0.95 [with synthetic data]).",Generic
"In this paper, we address the task of semantic-guided image generation. One challenge common to most existing image-level generation methods is the difficulty in generating small objects and detailed local textures. To address this, in this work we consider generating images using local context. As such, we design a local class-specific generative network using semantic maps as guidance, which separately constructs and learns subgenerators for different classes, enabling it to capture finer details. To learn more discriminative class-specific feature representations for the local generation, we also propose a novel classification module. To combine the advantages of both global image-level and local class-specific generation, a joint generation network is designed with an attention fusion module and a dual-discriminator structure embedded. Lastly, we propose a novel semantic-aware upsampling method, which has a larger receptive field and can take far-away pixels that are semantically related for feature upsampling, enabling it to better preserve semantic consistency for instances with the same semantic labels. Extensive experiments on two image generation tasks show the superior performance of the proposed method. State-of-the-art results are established by large margins on both tasks and on nine challenging public benchmarks.

"Deep learning models have been used in several domains, however, adjusting is still required to be applied in sensitive areas such as medical imaging. As the use of technology in the medical domain is needed because of the time limit, the level of accuracy assures trustworthiness. Because of privacy concerns, machine learning applications in the medical field are unable to use medical data. For example, the lack of brain MRI images makes it difficult to classify brain tumors using image-based classification. The solution to this challenge was achieved through the application of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based augmentation techniques. Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) and Vanilla GAN are two examples of GAN architectures used for image generation. In this paper, a framework, denoted as BrainGAN, for generating and classifying brain MRI images using GAN architectures and deep learning models was proposed. Consequently, this study proposed an automatic way to check that generated images are satisfactory. It uses three models: CNN, MobileNetV2, and ResNet152V2. Training the deep transfer models with images made by Vanilla GAN and DCGAN, and then evaluating their performance on a test set composed of real brain MRI images. From the results of the experiment, it was found that the ResNet152V2 model outperformed the other two models. The ResNet152V2 achieved 99.09% accuracy, 99.12% precision, 99.08% recall, 99.51% area under the curve (AUC), and 0.196 loss based on the brain MRI images generated by DCGAN architecture.",Generic
"Computed Tomography (CT) has become an important clinical imaging modality, as well as the leading source of radiation dose from medical imaging procedures. Modern CT exams are usually led by two quick orthogonal localization scans, which are used for patient positioning and diagnostic scan parameter definition. These two localization scans contribute to the patient dose but are not used for diagnosis purposes. In this study, we investigate the possibility of using deep learning models to reconstruct one localization scan image from the other, thus reducing the patient dose and simplifying the clinical workflow.",Generic
"Predicting brain aging can help in the early detection and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Longitudinal cohorts of healthy subjects scanned through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been essential to understand the structural brain changes due to aging. However, these cohorts suffer from missing data due to logistic issues in the recruitment of subjects. This paper proposes a methodology for filling up missing data in longitudinal cohorts with anatomically plausible images that capture the subject-specific aging process. The proposed methodology is developed within the framework of diffeomorphic registration. First, two novel modules are introduced within Synthmorph, a fast, state-of-the-art deep learning-based diffeomorphic registration method, to simulate the aging process between the first and last available MRI scan for each subject in three-dimensional (3D). The use of image registration also makes the generated images plausible by construction. Second, we used six image similarity measurements to rearrange the generated images to the specific age range. Finally, we estimated the age of every generated image by using the assumption of linear brain decay in healthy subjects. The methodology was evaluated on 2662 T1-weighted MRI scans from 796 healthy participants from 3 different longitudinal cohorts: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Open Access Series of Imaging Studies-3, and Group of Neuropsychological Studies of the Canary Islands (GENIC). In total, we generated 7548 images to simulate the access of a scan per subject every 6 months in these cohorts. We evaluated the quality of the synthetic images using six quantitative measurements and a qualitative assessment by an experienced neuroradiologist with state-of-the-art results. The assumption of linear brain decay was accurate in these cohorts (R<sup>2</sup> [.924, .940]). The experimental results show that the proposed methodology can produce anatomically plausible aging predictions that can be used to enhance longitudinal datasets. Compared to deep learning-based generative methods, diffeomorphic registration is more likely to preserve the anatomy of the different structures of the brain, which makes it more appropriate for its use in clinical applications. The proposed methodology is able to efficiently simulate anatomically plausible 3D MRI scans of brain aging of healthy subjects from two images scanned at two different time points.",Generic
"Multimodal images such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) could provide complementary information about the brain and have been widely investigated for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, multimodal brain images are often incomplete in clinical practice. It is still challenging to make use of multimodality for disease diagnosis with missing data. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework with the multi-level guided generative adversarial network (MLG-GAN) and multimodal transformer (Mul-T) for incomplete image generation and disease classification, respectively. First, MLG-GAN is proposed to generate the missing data, guided by multi-level information from voxels, features, and tasks. In addition to voxel-level supervision and task-level constraint, a feature-level auto-regression branch is proposed to embed the features of target images for an accurate generation. With the complete multimodal images, we propose a Mul-T network for disease diagnosis, which can not only combine the global and local features but also model the latent interactions and correlations from one modality to another with the cross-modal attention mechanism. Comprehensive experiments on three independent datasets (i.e., ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and OASIS-3) show that the proposed method achieves superior performance in the tasks of image generation and disease diagnosis compared to state-of-the-art methods.",Generic
"Recently, deep learning-based methods have been established to denoise the low-count positron emission tomography (PET) images and predict their standard-count image counterparts, which could achieve reduction of injected dosage and scan time, and improve image quality for equivalent lesion detectability and clinical diagnosis.

In this work, we applied a 3D U-Net network to reduce the noise of standard-count PET images to obtain the virtual-high-count (VHC) PET images for identifying the potential benefits of the obtained VHC PET images.",Generic
"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and their variants as an effective method for generating visually appealing images have shown great potential in different medical imaging applications during past decades. However, some issues remain insufficiently investigated: many models still suffer from model collapse, vanishing gradients, and convergence failure. Considering the fact that medical images differ from typical RGB images in terms of complexity and dimensionality, we propose an adaptive generative adversarial network, namely MedGAN, to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we first use Wasserstein loss as a convergence metric to measure the convergence degree of the generator and the discriminator. Then, we adaptively train MedGAN based on this metric. Finally, we generate medical images based on MedGAN and use them to build few-shot medical data learning models for disease classification and lesion localization. On demodicosis, blister, molluscum, and parakeratosis datasets, our experimental results verify the advantages of MedGAN in model convergence, training speed, and visual quality of generated samples. We believe this approach can be generalized to other medical applications and contribute to radiologists' efforts for disease diagnosis.

"Deep-learning (DL) based CT image generation methods are often evaluated using RMSE and SSIM. By contrast, conventional model-based image reconstruction (MBIR) methods are often evaluated using image properties such as resolution, noise, bias. Calculating such image properties requires time consuming Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. For MBIR, linearized analysis using first order Taylor expansion has been developed to characterize noise and resolution without MC simulations. This inspired us to investigate if linearization can be applied to DL networks to enable efficient characterization of resolution and noise. We used FBPConvNet as an example DL network and performed extensive numerical evaluations, including both computer simulations and real CT data. Our results showed that network linearization works well under normal exposure settings. For such applications, linearization can characterize image noise and resolutions without running MC simulations. We provide with this work the computational tools to implement network linearization. The efficiency and ease of implementation of network linearization can hopefully popularize the physics-related image quality measures for DL applications. Our methodology is general; it allows flexible compositions of DL nonlinear modules and linear operators such as filtered-backprojection (FBP). For the latter, we develop a generic method for computing the covariance images that is needed for network linearization.",Generic
"The synthesis of high-resolution remote sensing images based on text descriptions has great potential in many practical application scenarios. Although deep neural networks have achieved great success in many important remote sensing tasks, generating realistic remote sensing images from text descriptions is still very difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a novel text-to-image modern Hopfield network (Txt2Img-MHN). The main idea of Txt2Img-MHN is to conduct hierarchical prototype learning on both text and image embeddings with modern Hopfield layers. Instead of directly learning concrete but highly diverse text-image joint feature representations for different semantics, Txt2Img-MHN aims to learn the most representative prototypes from text-image embeddings, achieving a coarse-to-fine learning strategy. These learned prototypes can then be utilized to represent more complex semantics in the text-to-image generation task. To better evaluate the realism and semantic consistency of the generated images, we further conduct zero-shot classification on real remote sensing data using the classification model trained on synthesized images. Despite its simplicity, we find that the overall accuracy in the zero-shot classification may serve as a good metric to evaluate the ability to generate an image from text. Extensive experiments on the benchmark remote sensing text-image dataset demonstrate that the proposed Txt2Img-MHN can generate more realistic remote sensing images than existing methods. Code and pre-trained models are available online (https://github.com/YonghaoXu/Txt2Img-MHN).",Generic
"Research on coal foreign object detection based on deep learning is of great significance to safe, efficient, and green production of coal mines. However, the foreign object image dataset is scarce due to collection conditions, which brings an enormous challenge to coal foreign object detection. To achieve augmentation of foreign object datasets, a high-quality coal foreign object image generation method based on improved StyleGAN is proposed. Firstly, the dual self-attention module is introduced into the generator to strengthen the long-distance dependence of features between spatial and channel, refine the details of the generated images, accurately distinguish the front background information, and improve the quality of the generated images. Secondly, the depthwise separable convolution is introduced into the discriminator to solve the problem of low efficiency caused by the large number of parameters of multi-stage convolutional networks, to realize the lightweight model, and to accelerate the training speed. Experimental results show that the improved model has significant advantages over several classical GANS and original StyleGAN in terms of quality and diversity of the generated images, with an average improvement of 2.52 in IS and a decrease of 5.80 in FID for each category. As for the model complexity, the parameters and training time of the improved model are reduced to 44.6% and 58.8% of the original model without affecting the generated images quality.

"The metabolic heterogeneity and metabolic interplay between cells are known as significant contributors to disease treatment resistance. However, with the lack of a mature high-throughput single-cell metabolomics technology, we are yet to establish systematic understanding of the intra-tissue metabolic heterogeneity and cooperative mechanisms. To mitigate this knowledge gap, we developed a novel computational method, namely, single-cell flux estimation analysis (scFEA), to infer the cell-wise fluxome from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. scFEA is empowered by a systematically reconstructed human metabolic map as a factor graph, a novel probabilistic model to leverage the flux balance constraints on scRNA-seq data, and a novel graph neural network-based optimization solver. The intricate information cascade from transcriptome to metabolome was captured using multilayer neural networks to capitulate the nonlinear dependency between enzymatic gene expressions and reaction rates. We experimentally validated scFEA by generating an scRNA-seq data set with matched metabolomics data on cells of perturbed oxygen and genetic conditions. Application of scFEA on this data set showed the consistency between predicted flux and the observed variation of metabolite abundance in the matched metabolomics data. We also applied scFEA on five publicly available scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data sets and identified context- and cell group-specific metabolic variations. The cell-wise fluxome predicted by scFEA empowers a series of downstream analyses including identification of metabolic modules or cell groups that share common metabolic variations, sensitivity evaluation of enzymes with regards to their impact on the whole metabolic flux, and inference of cell-tissue and cell-cell metabolic communications.",Generic
"In this paper, we investigate the problem of graph neural network quantization. Despite the great success on convolutional neural networks, directly applying current network quantization approaches to graph neural networks faces two challenges. First, the fixed-scale parameter in the current methods cannot flexibly fit diverse tasks and network architectures. Second, the variations of node degree in a graph leads to uneven responses, limiting the accuracy of the quantizer. To address these two challenges, we introduce learnable scale parameters that can be optimized jointly with the graph networks. In addition, we propose degree-aware normalization to process nodes with different degrees. Experiments on different tasks, baselines, and datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method against previous state-of-the-art ones.",Generic
"Graphs can model complicated interactions between entities, which naturally emerge in many important applications. These applications can often be cast into standard graph learning tasks, in which a crucial step is to learn low-dimensional graph representations. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are currently the most popular model in graph embedding approaches. However, standard GNNs in the neighborhood aggregation paradigm suffer from limited discriminative power in distinguishing high-order graph structures as opposed to low-order structures. To capture high-order structures, researchers have resorted to motifs and developed motif-based GNNs. However, the existing motif-based GNNs still often suffer from less discriminative power on high-order structures. To overcome the above limitations, we propose motif GNN (MGNN), a novel framework to better capture high-order structures, hinging on our proposed motif redundancy minimization operator and injective motif combination. First, MGNN produces a set of node representations with respect to each motif. The next phase is our proposed redundancy minimization among motifs which compares the motifs with each other and distills the features unique to each motif. Finally, MGNN performs the updating of node representations by combining multiple representations from different motifs. In particular, to enhance the discriminative power, MGNN uses an injective function to combine the representations with respect to different motifs. We further show that our proposed architecture increases the expressive power of GNNs with a theoretical analysis. We demonstrate that MGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on seven public benchmarks on both the node classification and graph classification tasks.",Generic
"Cross-network node classification (CNNC), which aims to classify nodes in a label-deficient target network by transferring the knowledge from a source network with abundant labels, draws increasing attention recently. To address CNNC, we propose a domain-adaptive message passing graph neural network (DM-GNN), which integrates graph neural network (GNN) with conditional adversarial domain adaptation. DM-GNN is capable of learning informative representations for node classification that are also transferrable across networks. Firstly, a GNN encoder is constructed by dual feature extractors to separate ego-embedding learning from neighbor-embedding learning so as to jointly capture commonality and discrimination between connected nodes. Secondly, a label propagation node classifier is proposed to refine each node's label prediction by combining its own prediction and its neighbors' prediction. In addition, a label-aware propagation scheme is devised for the labeled source network to promote intra-class propagation while avoiding inter-class propagation, thus yielding label-discriminative source embeddings. Thirdly, conditional adversarial domain adaptation is performed to take the neighborhood-refined class-label information into account during adversarial domain adaptation, so that the class-conditional distributions across networks can be better matched. Comparisons with eleven state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DM-GNN.",Generic

"Graph neural networks are receiving increasing attention as state-of-the-art methods to process graph-structured data. However, similar to other neural networks, they tend to suffer from a high computational cost to perform training. Reservoir computing (RC) is an effective way to define neural networks that are very efficient to train, often obtaining comparable predictive performance with respect to the fully trained counterparts. Different proposals of reservoir graph neural networks have been proposed in the literature. However, their predictive performances are still slightly below the ones of fully trained graph neural networks on many benchmark datasets, arguably because of the oversmoothing problem that arises when iterating over the graph structure in the reservoir computation. In this work, we aim to reduce this gap defining a multiresolution reservoir graph neural network (MRGNN) inspired by graph spectral filtering. Instead of iterating on the nonlinearity in the reservoir and using a shallow readout function, we aim to generate an explicit k -hop unsupervised graph representation amenable for further, possibly nonlinear, processing. Experiments on several datasets from various application areas show that our approach is extremely fast and it achieves in most of the cases comparable or even higher results with respect to state-of-the-art approaches.",Generic

"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are recently proposed neural network structures for the processing of graph-structured data. Due to their employed neighbor aggregation strategy, existing GNNs focus on capturing node-level information and neglect high-level information.

To overcome these limitations and enrich the features captured by GNNs, we propose a novel GNN framework, referred to as the two-level GNN (TL-GNN). This merges subgraph-level information with node-level information. Moreover, we provide a mathematical analysis of the LPI problem, which demonstrates that subgraph-level information is beneficial to overcoming the problems associated with LPI. A subgraph counting method based on the dynamic programming algorithm is also proposed, and this has the time complexity of O(n<sup>3</sup>) , where n is the number of nodes of a graph.

"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the most promising deep learning models that can revolutionize non-Euclidean data analysis. However, their full potential is severely curtailed by poorly represented molecular graphs and features. Here, we propose a multiphysical graph neural network (MP-GNN) model based on the developed multiphysical molecular graph representation and featurization. All kinds of molecular interactions, between different atom types and at different scales, are systematically represented by a series of scale-specific and element-specific graphs with distance-related node features. From these graphs, graph convolution network (GCN) models are constructed with specially designed weight-sharing architectures. Base learners are constructed from GCN models from different elements at different scales, and further consolidated together using both one-scale and multi-scale ensemble learning schemes. Our MP-GNN has two distinct properties. First, our MP-GNN incorporates multiscale interactions using more than one molecular graph. Atomic interactions from various different scales are not modeled by one specific graph (as in traditional GNNs), instead they are represented by a series of graphs at different scales. Second, it is free from the complicated feature generation process as in conventional GNN methods. In our MP-GNN, various atom interactions are embedded into element-specific graph representations with only distance-related node features. A unique GNN architecture is designed to incorporate all the information into a consolidated model. Our MP-GNN has been extensively validated on the widely used benchmark test datasets from PDBbind, including PDBbind-v2007, PDBbind-v2013 and PDBbind-v2016. Our model can outperform all existing models as far as we know. Further, our MP-GNN is used in coronavirus disease 2019 drug design.

"Proteins are the fundamental biological macromolecules which underline practically all biological activities.

"Diagnosis prediction is an important predictive task in health care that aims to predict the patient future diagnosis based on their historical medical records. A crucial requirement for this task is to effectively model the high-dimensional, noisy, and temporal electronic health record (EHR) data.

Recently, more accurate and robust medical knowledge-guided methods have been proposed and have achieved superior performance. These methods inject the knowledge from a graph structure medical ontology into deep models via attention mechanisms to provide supplementary information of the input data. However, these methods only partially leverage the knowledge graph and neglect the global structure information, which is an important feature. To address this problem, we propose an end-to-end robust solution, namely Graph Neural Network-Based Diagnosis Prediction (GNDP). First, we propose to utilize the medical knowledge graph as an internal information of a patient by constructing sequential patient graphs. These graphs not only carry the historical information from the EHR but also infuse with domain knowledge. Then we design a robust diagnosis prediction model based on a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network. The proposed model extracts meaningful features from sequential graph EHR data effectively through multiple spatial-temporal graph convolution units to generate robust patients' representations for accurate diagnosis predictions. We evaluate the performance of GNDP against a set of state-of-the-art methods on two real-world medical data sets, the results demonstrate that our methods can achieve a better utilization of knowledge graph and improve the accuracy on diagnosis prediction tasks.",Generic
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in many fields due to their powerful capabilities of processing graph-structured data. However, most GNNs can only be applied to scenarios where graphs are known, but real-world data are often noisy or even do not have available graph structures. Recently, graph learning has attracted increasing attention in dealing with these problems. In this article, we develop a novel approach to improving the robustness of the GNNs, called composite GNN. Different from existing methods, our method uses composite graphs (C-graphs) to characterize both sample and feature relations. The C-graph is a unified graph that unifies these two kinds of relations, where edges between samples represent sample similarities, and each sample has a tree-based feature graph to model feature importance and combination preference. By jointly learning multiaspect C-graphs and neural network parameters, our method improves the performance of semisupervised node classification and ensures robustness. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of our method and the variants of our method that only learn sample relations or feature relations. Extensive experimental results on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the best performance on almost all the datasets and is robust to feature noises.",Generic
"The emergence of deep learning has not only brought great changes in the field of image recognition, but also achieved excellent node classification performance in graph neural networks. However, the existing graph neural network framework often uses methods based on spatial domain or spectral domain to capture network structure features. This process captures the local structural characteristics of graph data, and the convolution process has a large amount of calculation. It is necessary to use multi-channel or deep neural network structure to achieve the goal of modeling the high-order structural characteristics of the network. Therefore, this paper proposes a linear graph neural network framework [Linear Graph Neural Network (LGNN)] with superior performance. The model first preprocesses the input graph, and uses symmetric normalization and feature normalization to remove deviations in the structure and features. Then, by designing a high-order adjacency matrix propagation mechanism, LGNN enables nodes to iteratively aggregate and learn the feature information of high-order neighbors. After obtaining the node representation of the network structure, LGNN uses a simple linear mapping to maintain computational efficiency and obtain the final node representation. The experimental results show that the performance of the LGNN algorithm in some tasks is slightly worse than that of the existing mainstream graph neural network algorithms, but it shows or exceeds the machine learning performance of the existing algorithms in most graph neural network performance evaluation tasks, especially on sparse networks.",Generic
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become effective learning techniques for many downstream network mining tasks including node and graph classification, link prediction, and network reconstruction. However, most GNN methods have been developed for homogeneous networks with only a single type of node and edge. In this work we present muxGNN, a multiplex graph neural network for heterogeneous graphs. To model heterogeneity, we represent graphs as multiplex networks consisting of a set of relation layer graphs and a coupling graph that links node instantiations across multiple relations. We parameterize relation-specific representations of nodes and design a novel coupling attention mechanism that models the importance of multi-relational contexts for different types of nodes and edges in heterogeneous graphs. We further develop two complementary coupling structures: node invariant coupling suitable for node- and graph-level tasks, and node equivariant coupling suitable for link-level tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on six real-world datasets for link prediction in both transductive and inductive contexts and graph classification demonstrate the superior performance of muxGNN over state-of-the-art heterogeneous GNNs. In addition, we show that muxGNN's coupling attention discovers interpretable connections between different relations in heterogeneous networks.",Generic
"Drug repurposing is the process of discovering new indications (i.e., diseases or conditions) for already approved drugs. Many computational methods have been proposed for predicting new associations between drugs and diseases. In this article, we proposed a new method, called DR-HGNN, an integrative heterogeneous graph neural network-based method for multi-labeled drug repurposing, to discover new indications for existing drugs. For this purpose, we first used the DTINet dataset to construct a heterogeneous drug-protein-disease (DPD) network, which is a graph composed of four types of nodes (drugs, proteins, diseases, and drug side effects) and eight types of edges. Second, we labeled each drug-protein edge, <i>dp</i> <sub><i>i</i>,<i>j</i></sub> = (<i>d</i> <sub><i>i</i></sub> , <i>p</i> <sub><i>j</i></sub> ), of the DPD network with a set of diseases, {<i> </i> <sub><i>i</i>,<i>j</i>,1</sub>, , <i> </i> <sub><i>i</i>,<i>j</i>,<i>k</i></sub> } associated with both <i>d</i> <sub><i>i</i></sub> and <i>p</i> <sub><i>j</i></sub> and then devised multi-label ranking approaches which incorporate neural network architecture that operates on the heterogeneous graph-structured data and which leverages both the interaction patterns and the features of drug and protein nodes. We used a derivative of the GraphSAGE algorithm, HinSAGE, on the heterogeneous DPD network to learn low-dimensional vector representation of features of drugs and proteins. Finally, we used the drug-protein network to learn the embeddings of the drug-protein edges and then predict the disease labels that act as bridges between drugs and proteins. The proposed method shows better results than existing methods applied to the DTINet dataset, with an AUC of 0.964.",Generic
"The emergence of image-based systems to improve diagnostic pathology precision, involving the intent to label sets or bags of instances, greatly hinges on Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Images(WSIs).

We propose MIL-GNN to employ a graph-based Variational Auto-encoder with a Gaussian mixture model to discover relations between sample patches for the purposes to aggregate patch details into an individual vector representation. Using the classical MIL dataset MUSK and distinguishing two lung cancer sub-types, lung cancer called adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), we exhibit the efficacy of our technique. We achieved a 97.42% accuracy on the MUSK dataset and a 94.3% AUC on the classification of lung cancer sub-types utilizing features.",Generic
"Recent studies suggest that networks among firms (sectors) play a vital role in asset pricing. This paper investigates these implications and develops a novel end-to-end graph neural network model for asset pricing by combining and modifying two state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.

"Social-network-based recommendation algorithms leverage rich social network information to alleviate the problem of data sparsity and boost the recommendation performance. However, traditional social-network-based recommendation algorithms ignore high-order collaborative signals or only consider the first-order collaborative signal when learning users' and items' latent representations, resulting in suboptimal recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based social recommendation model that utilizes the GNN framework to capture high-order collaborative signals in the process of learning the latent representations of users and items. Specifically, we formulate the representations of entities, i.e., users and items, by stacking multiple embedding propagation layers to recursively aggregate multi-hop neighborhood information on both the user-item interaction graph and the social network graph. Hence, the collaborative signals hidden in both the user-item interaction graph and the social network graph are explicitly injected into the final representations of entities. Moreover, we ease the training process of the proposed GNN-based social recommendation model and alleviate overfitting by adopting a lightweight GNN framework that only retains the neighborhood aggregation component and abandons the feature transformation and nonlinear activation components. The experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our proposed GNN-based social recommendation method outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms.",Generic
"Misinformation has become a frightening specter of society, especially fake news that concerning Covid-19. It massively spreads on the Internet, and then induces misunderstandings of information to the national and global communities during the pandemic. Detecting massive misinformation on the Internet is crucial and challenging because humans have struggled against this phenomenon for a long time. Our research concerns detecting fake news related to covid-19 using augmentation [random deletion (RD), random insertion (RI), random swap (RS), synonym replacement (SR)] and several graph neural network [graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), and GraphSAGE (SAmple and aggreGatE)] model. We constructed nodes and edges in the graph, word-word node, and word-document node to graph neural network. Then, we tested those models in different amounts of sample training data to obtain accuracy for each model and compared them. For our fake news detection task, we found training accuracy steadily increasing for GCN, GAT, and SAGE models from the beginning to the end of the epochs. This result proved that the performance of GNN, whether GCN, GAT, or SAGE gained an entirely insignificant difference precision result.",Generic
"The identification of cancer genes is a critical yet challenging problem in cancer genomics research. Existing computational methods, including deep graph neural networks, fail to exploit the multilayered gene-gene interactions or provide limited explanations for their predictions. These methods are restricted to a single biological network, which cannot capture the full complexity of tumorigenesis. Models trained on different biological networks often yield different and even opposite cancer gene predictions, hindering their trustworthy adaptation. Here, we introduce an Explainable Multilayer Graph Neural Network (EMGNN) approach to identify cancer genes by leveraging multiple gene-gene interaction networks and pan-cancer multi-omics data. Unlike conventional graph learning on a single biological network, EMGNN uses a multilayered graph neural network to learn from multiple biological networks for accurate cancer gene prediction.",Generic
"Text classification is a fundamental research direction, aims to assign tags to text units. Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) have exhibited some excellent properties in textual information processing. Furthermore, the pre-trained language model also realized promising effects in many tasks. However, many text processing methods cannot model a single text unit's structure or ignore the semantic features. To solve these problems and comprehensively utilize the text's structure information and semantic information, we propose a Bert-Enhanced text Graph Neural Network model (BEGNN). For each text, we construct a text graph separately according to the co-occurrence relationship of words and use GNN to extract text features. Moreover, we employ Bert to extract semantic features. The former part can take into account the structural information, and the latter can focus on modeling the semantic information. Finally, we interact and aggregate these two features of different granularity to get a more effective representation. Experiments on standard datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BEGNN.",Generic
"Transportation networks play a crucial role in society by enabling the smooth movement of people and goods during regular times and acting as arteries for evacuations during catastrophes and natural disasters. Identifying the critical road segments in a large and complex network is essential for planners and emergency managers to enhance the network's efficiency, robustness, and resilience to such stressors. We propose a novel approach to rapidly identify critical and vital network components (road segments in a transportation network) for resilience improvement or post-disaster recovery. We pose the transportation network as a graph with roads as edges and intersections as nodes and deploy a Graph Neural Network (GNN) trained on a broad range of network parameter changes and disruption events to rank the importance of road segments. The trained GNN model can rapidly estimate the criticality rank of individual road segments in the modified network resulting from an interruption. We address two main limitations in the existing literature that can arise in capital planning or during emergencies: ranking a complete network after changes to components and addressing situations in post-disaster recovery sequencing where some critical segments cannot be recovered. Importantly, our approach overcomes the computational overhead associated with the repeated calculation of network performance metrics, which can limit its use in large networks. To highlight scenarios where our method can prove beneficial, we present examples of synthetic graphs and two real-world transportation networks. Through these examples, we show how our method can support planners and emergency managers in undertaking rapid decisions for planning infrastructure hardening measures in large networks or during emergencies, which otherwise would require repeated ranking calculations for the entire network.",Generic

"The stability of the gut microenvironment is inextricably linked to human health, with the onset of many diseases accompanied by dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. It has been reported that there are differences in the microbial community composition between patients and healthy individuals, and many microbes are considered potential biomarkers. Accurately identifying these biomarkers can lead to more precise and reliable clinical decision-making. To improve the accuracy of microbial biomarker identification, this study introduces WSGMB, a computational framework that uses the relative abundance of microbial taxa and health status as inputs. This method has two main contributions: (1) viewing the microbial co-occurrence network as a weighted signed graph and applying graph convolutional neural network techniques for graph classification; (2) designing a new architecture to compute the role transitions of each microbial taxon between health and disease networks, thereby identifying disease-related microbial biomarkers. The weighted signed graph neural network enhances the quality of graph embeddings; quantifying the importance of microbes in different co-occurrence networks better identifies those microbes critical to health. Microbes are ranked according to their importance change scores, and when this score exceeds a set threshold, the microbe is considered a biomarker. This framework's identification performance is validated by comparing the biomarkers identified by WSGMB with actual microbial biomarkers associated with specific diseases from public literature databases. The study tests the proposed computational framework using actual microbial community data from colorectal cancer and Crohn's disease samples. It compares it with the most advanced microbial biomarker identification methods. The results show that the WSGMB method outperforms similar approaches in the accuracy of microbial biomarker identification.",Generic
"In this article, we first propose a graph neural network encoding method for the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to handle the community detection problem in complex attribute networks. In the graph neural network encoding method, each edge in an attribute network is associated with a continuous variable. Through nonlinear transformation, a continuous valued vector (i.e., a concatenation of the continuous variables associated with the edges) is transferred to a discrete valued community grouping solution. Further, two objective functions for the single-attribute and multiattribute network are proposed to evaluate the attribute homogeneity of the nodes in communities, respectively. Based on the new encoding method and the two objectives, a MOEA based upon NSGA-II, called continuous encoding MOEA, is developed for the transformed community detection problem with continuous decision variables. Experimental results on single-attribute and multiattribute networks with different types show that the developed algorithm performs significantly better than some well-known evolutionary- and nonevolutionary-based algorithms. The fitness landscape analysis verifies that the transformed community detection problems have smoother landscapes than those of the original problems, which justifies the effectiveness of the proposed graph neural network encoding method.",Generic

"Transforming user check-in data into graph structure data is a popular and powerful way to analyze users' behaviors in the field of recommendation. Graph-based deep learning methods such as graph embeddings and graph neural networks have shown promising performance on the task of point-of-interest recommendation in recent years. Despite effectiveness, existing methods fail to capture deep graph structural information, leading the suboptimal representations. In addition, they lack the ability of learning the influences of both global preference and user preference on the check-in behavior. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a general framework based on preference-aware graph diffusion, named PGD. We first construct two types of graphs to represent the global preference and user preference. Then, we apply a graph diffusion process to capture the structural information of the generated graphs, resulting in weighted adjacency matrices. Finally, graph neural network-based backbones are introduced to learn the representations of users and POIs on weighted adjacency matrices. A learnable aggregation module is developed to learn the final representations from global preference and user preference adaptively. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of PGD on POI recommendation, compared with the mainstream graph-based deep learning methods.",Generic
"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) silence genes by binding to messenger RNAs, whereas long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) that can relieve miRNA silencing effects and upregulate target gene expression. The ceRNA association between lncRNAs and miRNAs has been a research hotspot due to its medical importance, but it is challenging to verify experimentally. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning scheme, i.e. sequence pre-training-based graph neural network (SPGNN), that combines pre-training and fine-tuning stages to predict lncRNA-miRNA associations from RNA sequences and the existing interactions represented as a graph. First, we utilize a sequence-to-vector technique to generate pre-trained embeddings based on the sequences of all RNAs during the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage, we use Graph Neural Network to learn node representations from the heterogeneous graph constructed using lncRNA-miRNA association information. We evaluate our proposed scheme SPGNN on our newly collected animal lncRNA-miRNA association dataset and demonstrate that combining the $k$-mer technique and Doc2vec model for pre-training with the Simple Graph Convolution Network for fine-tuning is effective in predicting lncRNA-miRNA associations. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various evaluation metrics. We also conduct an ablation study and hyperparameter analysis to verify the effectiveness of each component and parameter of our scheme.

"Bearings are very important components in mechanical equipment, and detecting bearing failures helps ensure healthy operation of mechanical equipment and can prevent catastrophic accidents. Most of the well-established detection methods do not take into account the correlation between signals and are difficult to accurately identify those fault samples that have a low degree of failure. To address this problem, we propose a graph neural network-based bearing fault detection (GNNBFD) method. The method first constructs a graph using the similarity between samples; secondly the constructed graph is fed into a graph neural network (GNN) for feature mapping, and the samples outputted by the GNN network fuse the feature information of their neighbors, which is beneficial to the downstream detection task; then the samples mapped by the GNN network are fed into base detector for fault detection; finally, the results determined by the integrated base detector algorithm are determined, and the top n samples with the highest outlier scores are the faulty samples. The experimental results with five state-of-the-art algorithms on publicly available datasets show that the GNNBFD algorithm improves the AUC by 6.4% compared to the next best algorithm, proving that the GNNBFD algorithm is effective and feasible.",Generic
"Multispectral satellite imagery offers a new perspective for spatial modelling, change detection and land cover classification. The increased demand for accurate classification of geographically diverse regions led to advances in object-based methods. A novel spatiotemporal method is presented for object-based land cover classification of satellite imagery using a Graph Neural Network. This paper introduces innovative representation of sequential satellite images as a directed graph by connecting segmented land region through time. The method's novel modular node classification pipeline utilises the Convolutional Neural Network as a multispectral image feature extraction network, and the Graph Neural Network as a node classification model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we utilised EfficientNetV2-S for feature extraction and the GraphSAGE algorithm with Long Short-Term Memory aggregation for node classification. This innovative application on Sentinel-2 L2A imagery produced complete 4-year intermonthly land cover classification maps for two regions: Graz in Austria, and the region of Portoro , Izola and Koper in Slovenia. The regions were classified with Corine Land Cover classes. In the level 2 classification of the Graz region, the method outperformed the state-of-the-art UNet model, achieving an average F1-score of 0.841 and an accuracy of 0.831, as opposed to UNet's 0.824 and 0.818, respectively.

"Identifying lncRNA-disease associations is conducive to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases. Due to the expensive and time-consuming methods verified by biological experiments, prediction methods based on computational models have gradually become an important means of lncRNA-disease associations discovery. However, existing methods still have challenges to make full use of network topology information to identify potential associations between lncRNA and disease in multi-source data. In this study, we propose a novel method called HGNNLDA for lncRNA-disease association prediction. First, HGNNLDA constructs a heterogeneous network composed of lncRNA similarity network, lncRNA-disease association network and lncRNA-miRNA association network; Then, on this heterogeneous network, various types of strong correlation neighbors with fixed size are sampled for each node by restart random walk; Next, the embedding information of lncRNA and disease in each lncRNA-disease association pair is obtained by the method of type-based neighbor aggregation and all types combination though heterogeneous graph neural network, in which attention mechanism is introduced considering that different types of neighbors will make different contributions to the prediction of lncRNA-disease association. As a result, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) under fivefold cross-validation (5FCV) are 0.9786 and 0.8891, respectively. Compared with five state-of-art prediction models, HGNNLDA has better prediction performance. In addition, in two types of case studies, it is further verified that our method can effectively predict the potential lncRNA-disease associations, and have ability to predict new diseases without any known lncRNAs.",Generic
"In this paper, we model a knowledge graph based on graph neural networks, conduct an in-depth study on building knowledge graph embeddings for policing cases, and design a graph neural network-enhanced knowledge graph framework. In detail, we use the label propagation algorithm (LPA) to assist the convolutional graph network (GCN) in training the edge weights of the knowledge graph to construct a policing case prediction method. This improves the traditional convolutional neural network from a single-channel network to a multichannel network to accommodate the multiple feature factors of policing cases. In addition, this expands the perceptual field of the convolutional neural network to improve prediction accuracy. The experimental results show that the multichannel convolutional neural network's prediction accuracy can reach 87.7%. To ensure the efficiency of the security case analysis network, an efficient pairwise feature extraction base module is added to enhance the backbone network, which reduces the number of parameters of the whole network and decreases the complexity of operations.

"Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is an essential step in drug repositioning. A few graph neural network (GNN)-based methods have been proposed for DTI prediction using heterogeneous biological data.

In this paper, we propose a metapath-aggregated heterogeneous graph neural network (MHGNN) to capture complex structures and rich semantics in the biological heterogeneous graph for DTI prediction. Specifically, MHGNN enhances heterogeneous graph structure learning and high-order semantics learning by modeling high-order relations via metapaths. Additionally, MHGNN enriches high-order correlations between drug-target pairs (DTPs) by constructing a DTP correlation graph with DTPs as nodes. We conduct extensive experiments on three biological heterogeneous datasets. MHGNN favorably surpasses 17 state-of-the-art methods over 6 evaluation metrics, which verifies its efficacy for DTI prediction.

"Many biological systems are characterised by biological entities, as well as their relationships. These interaction networks can be modelled as graphs, with nodes representing bio-entities, such as molecules, and edges representing relations among them, such as interactions.

In this scenario, graph neural networks (GNNs) are recent computational approaches that directly deal with graph-structured data. In this paper, we present a GNN network for the analysis of siRNA-mRNA interaction networks. siRNAs, in fact, are small RNA molecules that are able to bind to target genes and silence them. These events make siRNAs key molecules as RNA interference agents in many biological interaction networks related to severe diseases such as cancer. In particular, our GNN approach allows for the prediction of the siRNA efficacy, which measures the siRNA's ability to bind and silence a gene target. Tested on benchmark datasets, our proposed method overcomes other machine learning algorithms, including the state-of-the-art predictor based on the convolutional neural network, reaching a Pearson correlation coefficient of approximately 73.6%.

"More and more studies have shown that understanding microbe-disease associations cannot only reveal the pathogenesis of diseases, but also promote the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. Because traditional medical experiments are time-consuming and expensive, many computational methods have been proposed in recent years to identify potential microbe-disease associations. In this study, we propose a method based on heterogeneous network and metapath aggregated graph neural network (MAGNN) to predict microbe-disease associations, called MATHNMDA. First, we introduce microbe-drug interactions, drug-disease associations, and microbe-disease associations to construct a microbe-drug-disease heterogeneous network. Then we take the heterogeneous network as input to MAGNN. Second, for each layer of MAGNN, we carry out intra-metapath aggregation with a multi-head attention mechanism to learn the structural and semantic information embedded in the target node context, the metapath-based neighbor nodes, and the context between them, by encoding the metapath instances under the metapath definition mode. We then use inter-metapath aggregation with an attention mechanism to combine the semantic information of all different metapaths. Third, we can get the final embedding of microbe nodes and disease nodes based on the output of the last layer in the MAGNN. Finally, we predict potential microbe-disease associations by reconstructing the microbe-disease association matrix. In addition, we evaluated the performance of MATHNMDA by comparing it with that of its variants, some state-of-the-art methods, and different datasets. The results suggest that MATHNMDA is an effective prediction method. The case studies on asthma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) further validate the effectiveness of MATHNMDA.",Generic
"In drug development, unexpected side effects are the main reason for the failure of candidate drug trials. Discovering potential side effects of drugsin silicocan improve the success rate of drug screening. However, most previous works extracted and utilized an effective representation of drugs from a single perspective. These methods merely considered the topological information of drug in the biological entity network, or combined the association information (e.g. knowledge graph KG) between drug and other biomarkers, or only used the chemical structure or sequence information of drug. Consequently, to jointly learn drug features from both the macroscopic biological network and the microscopic drug molecules. We propose a hybrid embedding graph neural network model named idse-HE, which integrates graph embedding module and node embedding module. idse-HE can fuse the drug chemical structure information, the drug substructure sequence information and the drug network topology information. Our model deems the final representation of drugs and side effects as two implicit factors to reconstruct the original matrix and predicts the potential side effects of drugs. In the robustness experiment, idse-HE shows stable performance in all indicators. We reproduce the baselines under the same conditions, and the experimental results indicate that idse-HE is superior to other advanced methods. Finally, we also collect evidence to confirm several real drug side effect pairs in the predicted results, which were previously regarded as negative samples. More detailed information, scientific researchers can access the user-friendly web-server of idse-HE at http://bioinfo.jcu.edu.cn/idse-HE.

"Identifying the potential compound-protein interactions (CPIs) plays an essential role in drug development. The computational approaches for CPI prediction can reduce time and costs of experimental methods and have benefited from the continuously improved graph representation learning. However, most of the network-based methods use heterogeneous graphs, which is challenging due to their complex structures and heterogeneous attributes. Therefore, in this work, we transformed the compound-protein heterogeneous graph to a homogeneous graph by integrating the ligand-based protein representations and overall similarity associations.

"The utilization of web search activity for pandemic forecasting has significant implications for managing disease spread and informing policy decisions. However, web search records tend to be noisy and influenced by geographical location, making it difficult to develop large-scale models. While regularized linear models have been effective in predicting the spread of respiratory illnesses like COVID-19, they are limited to specific locations. The lack of incorporation of neighboring areas' data and the inability to transfer models to new locations with limited data has impeded further progress. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel self-supervised message-passing neural network (SMPNN) framework for modeling local and cross-location dynamics in pandemic forecasting. The SMPNN framework utilizes an MPNN module to learn cross-location dependencies through self-supervised learning and improve local predictions with graph-generated features. The framework is designed as an end-to-end solution and is compared with state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning models using COVID-19 data from England and the US. The results of the study demonstrate that the SMPNN model outperforms other models by achieving up to a 6.9% improvement in prediction accuracy and lower prediction errors during the early stages of disease outbreaks. This approach represents a significant advancement in disease surveillance and forecasting, providing a novel methodology, datasets, and insights that combine web search data and spatial information. The proposed SMPNN framework offers a promising avenue for modeling the spread of pandemics, leveraging both local and cross-location information, and has the potential to inform public health policy decisions.",Generic
"With the help of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable performance in face super-resolution (FSR) task. Despite their success, most of the existing methods neglect non-local correlations of face images, leaving much room for improvement. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end trainable attention-driven graph neural network (AD-GNN) for more discriminative feature extraction and feature relation modeling. This is achieved by two major components. The first component is a cross-scale dynamic graph (CDG) block. The CDG block considers cross-scale relationships of patches in distant areas and employs two dynamic graphs to construct enhanced features. The second component is a series of channel attention and spatial dynamic graph (CASDG) blocks. A CASDG block has a channel-wise attention unit and a spatial-aware dynamic graph (SDG) unit. The SDG unit extracts informative features by exploring spatial non-local self-similarity information of the patches using dynamic graph convolution. Using these two components, facial details can be effectively reconstructed with the help of information supplemented by similar but spatially remote patches and structural information of faces. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of AD-GNN over the state-of-the-art FSR methods.",Generic
"Cancer prognosis prediction and analysis can help patients understand expected life and help clinicians provide correct therapeutic guidance. Thanks to the development of sequencing technology, multi-omics data, and biological networks have been used for cancer prognosis prediction. Besides, graph neural networks can simultaneously consider multi-omics features and molecular interactions in biological networks, becoming mainstream in cancer prognosis prediction and analysis. However, the limited number of neighboring genes in biological networks restricts the accuracy of graph neural networks. To solve this problem, a local augmented graph convolutional network named LAGProg is proposed in this paper for cancer prognosis prediction and analysis. The process follows: first, given a patient's multi-omics data features and biological network, the corresponding augmented conditional variational autoencoder generates features. Then, the generated augmented features and the original features are fed into a cancer prognosis prediction model to complete the cancer prognosis prediction task. The conditional variational autoencoder consists of two parts: encoder-decoder. In the encoding phase, an encoder learns the conditional distribution of the multi-omics data. As a generative model, a decoder takes the conditional distribution and the original feature as inputs to generate the enhanced features. The cancer prognosis prediction model consists of a two-layer graph convolutional neural network and a Cox proportional risk network. The Cox proportional risk network consists of fully connected layers. Extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets from TCGA demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in predicting cancer prognosis. LAGProg improved the C-index values by an average of 8.5% over the state-of-the-art graph neural network method. Moreover, we confirmed that the local augmentation technique could enhance the model's ability to represent multi-omics features, improve the model's robustness to missing multi-omics features, and prevent the model's over-smoothing during training. Finally, based on genes identified through differential expression analysis, we discovered 13 prognostic markers highly associated with breast cancer, among which ten genes have been proved by literature review.",Generic
"Sequential recommendation uses contrastive learning to randomly augment user sequences and alleviate the data sparsity problem. However, there is no guarantee that the augmented positive or negative views remain semantically similar. To address this issue, we propose graph neural network-guided contrastive learning for sequential recommendation (GC4SRec). The guided process employs graph neural networks to obtain user embeddings, an encoder to determine the importance score of each item, and various data augmentation methods to construct a contrast view based on the importance score. Experimental validation is conducted on three publicly available datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that GC4SRec improves the hit rate and normalized discounted cumulative gain metrics by 1.4% and 1.7%, respectively. The model can enhance recommendation performance and mitigate the data sparsity problem.",Generic
"Medication combination prediction (MCP) can provide assistance for experts in the more thorough comprehension of complex mechanisms behind health and disease. Many recent studies focus on the patient representation from the historical medical records, but neglect the value of the medical knowledge, such as the prior knowledge and the medication knowledge. This article develops a medical-knowledge-based graph neural network (MK-GNN) model which incorporates the representation of patients and the medical knowledge into the neural network. More specifically, the features of patients are extracted from their medical records in different feature subspaces. Then these features are concatenated to obtain the feature representation of patients. The prior knowledge, which is calculated according to the mapping relationship between medications and diagnoses, provides heuristic medication features according to the diagnosis results. Such medication features can help the MK-GNN model learn optimal parameters. Moreover, the medication relationship in prescriptions is formulated as a drug network to integrate the medication knowledge into medication representation vectors. The results reveal the superior performance of the MK-GNN model compared with the state-of-the-art baselines on different evaluation metrics. The case study manifests the application potential of the MK-GNN model.",Generic
"Signed graph neural networks learn low-dimensional representations for nodes in signed networks with positive and negative links, which helps with many downstream tasks like link prediction. However, most existing signed graph neural networks ignore individual characteristics of nodes and thus limit the ability to learn the underlying structure of real signed graphs. To address this limitation, a deep graph neural network framework SiNP to learn Signed network embedding with Node Polarity is proposed. To be more explicit, a node-signed property metric mechanism is developed to encode the individual characteristics of the nodes. In addition, a graph convolution layer is added so that both positive and negative information from neighboring nodes can be combined. The final embedding of nodes is produced by concatenating the outcomes of these two portions. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted on four significant real-world signed network datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the proposed method in comparison to the state-of-the-art.",Generic
"Single-cell data analysis has been at forefront of development in biology and medicine since sequencing data have been made available. An important challenge in single-cell data analysis is the identification of cell types. Several methods have been proposed for cell-type identification. However, these methods do not capture the higher-order topological relationship between different samples. In this work, we propose an attention-based graph neural network that captures the higher-order topological relationship between different samples and performs transductive learning for predicting cell types. The evaluation of our method on both simulation and publicly available datasets demonstrates the superiority of our method, scAGN, in terms of prediction accuracy. In addition, our method works best for highly sparse datasets in terms of F1 score, precision score, recall score, and Matthew's correlation coefficients as well. Further, our method's runtime complexity is consistently faster compared to other methods.",Generic
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful architectures for learning on graphs. They are efficient for predicting nodes, links and graphs properties. Standard GNN variants follow a message passing schema to update nodes representations using information from higher-order neighborhoods iteratively. Consequently, deeper GNNs make it possible to define high-level nodes representations generated based on local as well as distant neighborhoods. However, deeper networks are prone to suffer from over-smoothing. To build deeper GNN architectures and avoid losing the dependency between lower (the layers closer to the input) and higher (the layers closer to the output) layers, networks can integrate residual connections to connect intermediate layers. We propose the Augmented Graph Neural Network (AGNN) model with hierarchical global-based residual connections. Using the proposed residual connections, the model generates high-level nodes representations without the need for a deeper architecture. We disclose that the nodes representations generated through our proposed AGNN model are able to define an expressive all-encompassing representation of the entire graph. As such, the graph predictions generated through the AGNN model surpass considerably state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we carry out extensive experiments to identify the best global pooling strategy and attention weights to define the adequate hierarchical and global-based residual connections for different graph property prediction tasks. Furthermore, we propose a reversible variant of the AGNN model to address the extensive memory consumption problem that typically arises from training networks on large and dense graph datasets. The proposed Reversible Augmented Graph Neural Network (R-AGNN) only stores the nodes representations acquired from the output layer as opposed to saving all representations from intermediate layers as it is conventionally done when optimizing the parameters of other GNNs. We further refine the definition of the backpropagation algorithm to fit the R-AGNN model. We evaluate the proposed models AGNN and R-AGNN on benchmark Molecular, Bioinformatics and Social Networks datasets for graph classification and achieve state-of-the-art results. For instance the AGNN model realizes improvements of +39% on IMDB-MULTI reaching 91.7% accuracy and +16% on COLLAB reaching 96.8% accuracy compared to other GNN variants.",Generic
"As a critical indicator of how easily the human immune system recognizes tumour cells, tumour mutational burden (TMB) is widely used to identify the potential effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. However, the difficulties associated with the whole exome sequencing (WES) process, such as high tissue sampling requirements, high costs, and long turnaround times, have hindered the widespread clinical use of WES. Furthermore, the mutation landscape varies across cancer types, and the distribution of TMBs varies across cancer subtypes. Therefore, there is an urgent clinical need to develop a small cancer-specific panel to estimate TMB accurately, predict immunotherapy response cost-effectively and assist physicians in precise decision-making. This paper uses a graph neural network framework (Graph-ETMB) to address the cancer specificity problem in TMB. The correlation and tractability between mutated genes are described through message-passing and aggregation algorithms between graph networks. Then the graph neural network is trained in the lung adenocarcinoma data through a semi-supervised approach, resulting in a mutation panel containing 20 genes with a length of only 0.16 Mb. The number of genes to be detected is smaller than most commercial panels currently in clinical use. In addition, the efficacy of the designed panel in predicting immunotherapy response was further determined in an independent validation dataset, exploring the association between TMB and immunotherapy efficacy.",Generic
"Interval-valued data is an effective way to represent complex information where uncertainty, inaccuracy etc. are involved in the data space and they are worthy of taking into account. Interval analysis together with neural network has proven to work well on Euclidean data. However, in real-life scenarios, data follows a much more complex structure and is often represented as graphs, which is non-Euclidean in nature. Graph Neural Network is a powerful tool to handle graph like data with countable feature space. So, there is a research gap between the interval-valued data handling approaches and existing GNN model. No model in GNN literature can handle a graph with interval-valued features and, on the other hand, Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) based on interval mathematics can not process the same due to non-Euclidean structure behind the graph. This article proposes an Interval-Valued Graph Neural Network, a novel GNN model where, for the first time, we relax the restriction of the feature space being countable without compromising the time complexity of the best performing GNN model in the literature. Our model is much more general than existing models as any countable set is always a subset of the universal set <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <msup><mrow><mi> </mi></mrow> <mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow> </msup> </math> , which is uncountable. Here, to deal with interval-valued feature vectors, we propose a new aggregation scheme of intervals and show its expressive power to capture different interval structures. We validate our theoretical findings about our model for graph classification task by comparing its performance with those of the state-of-the-art models on several benchmark and synthetic network datasets.",Generic
"The graph neural network (GNN) has demonstrated its superior power in various data mining tasks and has been widely applied in diversified fields. The core of GNN is the aggregation and combination functions, and mainstream GNN studies focus on the enhancement of these functions. However, GNNs face a common challenge, i.e., useless features contained in neighbor nodes may be integrated into the target node during the aggregation process. This leads to poor node embedding and undermines downstream tasks. To tackle this problem, this article proposes a novel GNN optimization framework GNN-MHSIC by introducing the nonparametric dependence method Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) under the guidance of information bottleneck. HSIC is utilized to guide the information propagation among layers of a GNN from multiaspect views. GNN-MHSIC aims to achieve three main objectives: 1) minimizing the HSIC between the input features and the propagation layers; 2) maximizing the HSIC between the propagation layers and the ground truth; and 3) minimizing the HSIC between the propagation layers. With a multiaspect design, GNN-MHSIC can minimize the propagation of redundant information while preserving relevant information about the target node. We prove GNN-MHSIC's finite upper and lower bounds theoretically and evaluate it experimentally with four classic GNN models, including the graph convolutional network, the graph attention network (GAT), the heterogeneous GAT, and the heterogeneous graph (HG) propagation network on three widely used HGs. The results illustrate the usefulness and performance of GNN-MHSIC.",Generic
"The accurate extraction of wheat lodging areas can provide important technical support for post-disaster yield loss assessment and lodging-resistant wheat breeding. At present, wheat lodging assessment is facing the contradiction between timeliness and accuracy, and there is also a lack of effective lodging extraction methods. This study aims to propose a wheat lodging assessment method applicable to multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight heights. The quadrotor UAV was used to collect high-definition images of wheat canopy at the grain filling and maturity stages, and the Unet network was evaluated and improved by introducing the Involution operator and Dense block module. The performance of the Improved_Unet was determined using the data collected from different flight heights, and the robustness of the improved network was verified with data from different years in two different geographical locations. The results of analyses show that (1) the Improved_Unet network was better than other networks (Segnet, Unet and DeeplabV3+ networks) evaluated in terms of segmentation accuracy, with the average improvement of each indicator being 3% and the maximum average improvement being 6%. The Improved_Unet network was more effective in extracting wheat lodging areas at the maturity stage. The four evaluation indicators, Precision, Dice, Recall, and Accuracy, were all the highest, which were 0.907, 0.929, 0.884, and 0.933, respectively; (2) the Improved_Unet network had the strongest robustness, and its Precision, Dice, Recall, and Accuracy reached 0.851, 0.892, 0.844, and 0.885, respectively, at the verification stage of using lodging data from other wheat production areas; and (3) the flight height had an influence on the lodging segmentation accuracy. The results of verification show that the 20-m flight height performed the best among the flight heights of 20, 40, 80 and 120 m evaluated, and the segmentation accuracy decreased with the increase of the flight height. The Precision, Dice, Recall, and Accuracy of the Improved_Unet changed from 0.907 to 0.845, from 0.929 to 0.864, from 0.884 to 0.841, and from 0.933 to 0.881, respectively.

The proposed deep learning network can effectively extract the areas of wheat lodging, and the different height fusion models developed from this study can provide a more comprehensive reference for the automatic extraction of wheat lodging.",Generic
"To suppress the streak artifacts in images reconstructed from sparse-view projections in computed tomography (CT), a residual, attention-based, dense UNet (RAD-UNet) deep network is proposed to achieve accurate sparse reconstruction. The filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm is used to reconstruct the CT image with streak artifacts from sparse-view projections. Then, the image is processed by the RAD-UNet to suppress streak artifacts and obtain high-quality CT image. Those images with streak artifacts are used as the input of the RAD-UNet, and the output-label images are the corresponding high-quality images. Through training via the large-scale training data, the RAD-UNet can obtain the capability of suppressing streak artifacts. This network combines residual connection, attention mechanism, dense connection and perceptual loss. This network can improve the nonlinear fitting capability and the performance of suppressing streak artifacts. The experimental results show that the RAD-UNet can improve the reconstruction accuracy compared with three existing representative deep networks. It may not only suppress streak artifacts but also better preserve image details. The proposed networks may be readily applied to other image processing tasks including image denoising, image deblurring, and image super-resolution.",Generic
"The U-Net architecture is a prominent technique for image segmentation. However, a significant challenge in utilizing this algorithm is the selection of appropriate hyperparameters. In this study, we aimed to address this issue using an evolutionary approach. We conducted experiments on four different geometric datasets (triangle, kite, parallelogram, and square), with 1,000 training samples and 200 test samples. Initially, we performed image segmentation without the evolutionary approach, manually adjusting the U-Net hyperparameters. The average accuracy rates for the geometric images were 0.94463, 0.96289, 0.96962, and 0.93971, respectively. Subsequently, we proposed a hybrid version of the U-Net architecture, incorporating the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) for an evolutionary approach. This method automatically discovered the optimal hyperparameters, resulting in improved image segmentation performance. The average accuracy rates achieved by the proposed method were 0.99418, 0.99673, 0.99143, and 0.99946, respectively, for the geometric images. Comparative analysis revealed that the proposed UNet-GOA approach outperformed the traditional U-Net architecture, yielding higher accuracy rates.",Generic
"Prostate cancer is a common disease that seriously endangers the health of middle-aged and elderly men. MRI images are the gold standard for assessing the health status of the prostate region.

"The outbreak of new coronary pneumonia has brought severe health risks to the world. Detection of COVID-19 based on the UNet network has attracted widespread attention in medical image segmentation. However, the traditional UNet model is challenging to capture the long-range dependence of the image due to the limitations of the convolution kernel with a fixed receptive field. The Transformer Encoder overcomes the long-range dependence problem. However, the Transformer-based segmentation approach cannot effectively capture the fine-grained details. We propose a transformer with a double decoder UNet for COVID-19 lesions segmentation to address this challenge, TDD-UNet. We introduce the multi-head self-attention of the Transformer to the UNet encoding layer to extract global context information. The dual decoder structure is used to improve the result of foreground segmentation by predicting the background and applying deep supervision. We performed quantitative analysis and comparison for our proposed method on four public datasets with different modalities, including CT and CXR, to demonstrate its effectiveness and generality in segmenting COVID-19 lesions. We also performed ablation studies on the COVID-19-CT-505 dataset to verify the effectiveness of the key components of our proposed model.

"Personalized heart models are widely used to study the mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias and have been used to guide clinical ablation of different types of arrhythmias in recent years. MRI images are now mostly used for model building. In cardiac modeling studies, the degree of segmentation of the heart image determines the success of subsequent 3D reconstructions. Therefore, a fully automated segmentation is needed. In this paper, we combine U-Net and Transformer as an alternative approach to perform powerful and fully automated segmentation of medical images. On the one hand, we use convolutional neural networks for feature extraction and spatial encoding of inputs to fully exploit the advantages of convolution in detail grasping; on the other hand, we use Transformer to add remote dependencies to high-level features and model features at different scales to fully exploit the advantages of Transformer. The results show that, the average dice coefficients for ACDC and Synapse datasets are 91.72 and 85.46%, respectively, and compared with Swin-Unet, the segmentation accuracy are improved by 1.72% for ACDC dataset and 6.33% for Synapse dataset.",Generic
"Since the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic in late 2019, medical imaging has been widely used to analyze this disease. Indeed, CT-scans of the lungs can help diagnose, detect, and quantify Covid-19 infection. In this paper, we address the segmentation of Covid-19 infection from CT-scans. To improve the performance of the Att-Unet architecture and maximize the use of the Attention Gate, we propose the PAtt-Unet and DAtt-Unet architectures. PAtt-Unet aims to exploit the input pyramids to preserve the spatial awareness in all of the encoder layers. On the other hand, DAtt-Unet is designed to guide the segmentation of Covid-19 infection inside the lung lobes. We also propose to combine these two architectures into a single one, which we refer to as PDAtt-Unet. To overcome the blurry boundary pixels segmentation of Covid-19 infection, we propose a hybrid loss function. The proposed architectures were tested on four datasets with two evaluation scenarios (intra and cross datasets). Experimental results showed that both PAtt-Unet and DAtt-Unet improve the performance of Att-Unet in segmenting Covid-19 infections. Moreover, the combination architecture PDAtt-Unet led to further improvement.

"The accurate segmentation of retinal vessels images can not only be used to evaluate and monitor various ophthalmic diseases, but also timely reflect systemic diseases such as diabetes and blood diseases. Therefore, the study on segmentation of retinal vessels images is of great significance for the diagnosis of visually threatening diseases. In recent years, especially the convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on UNet and its variant have been widely used in various medical image tasks. However, although CNN has achieved excellent performance, it cannot learn global and long-distance semantic information interaction well due to the local computing characteristics of convolution operation, which limits the development of medical image segmentation tasks. Transformer, currently popular in computer vision, has global computing features, but due to the lack of low-level details, local feature information extraction is insufficient. In this paper, we propose Patches Convolution Attention based Transformer UNet (PCAT-UNet), which is a U-shaped network based on Transformer with a Convolution branch. We use skip connection to fuse the deep and shallow features of both sides. By taking advantage of the complementary advantages of both sides, we can effectively capture the global dependence relationship and the details of the underlying feature space, thus improving the current problems of insufficient extraction of retinal micro vessels feature information and low sensitivity caused by easily predicting of pixels as background. In addition, our method enables end-to-end training and rapid inference. Finally, three publicly available retinal vessels datasets (DRIVE, STARE and CHASE_DB1) were used to evaluate PCAT-UNet. The experimental results show that the proposed PCAT-UNET method achieves good retinal vessel segmentation performance on these three datasets, and is superior to other architectures in terms of AUC, Accuracy and Sensitivity performance indicators. AUC reached 0.9872, 0.9953 and 0.9925, Accuracy reached 0.9622, 0.9796 and 0.9812, Sensitivity reached 0.8576, 0.8703 and 0.8493, respectively.

"Medical image segmentation is crucial for medical image processing and the development of computer-aided diagnostics. In recent years, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely adopted for medical image segmentation and have achieved significant success. UNet, which is based on CNNs, is the mainstream method used for medical image segmentation. However, its performance suffers owing to its inability to capture long-range dependencies. Transformers were initially designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP), and sequence-to-sequence applications have demonstrated the ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, their abilities to acquire local information are limited. Hybrid architectures of CNNs and Transformer, such as TransUNet, have been proposed to benefit from Transformer's long-range dependencies and CNNs' low-level details. Nevertheless, automatic medical image segmentation remains a challenging task due to factors such as blurred boundaries, the low-contrast tissue environment, and in the context of ultrasound, issues like speckle noise and attenuation. In this paper, we propose a new model that combines the strengths of both CNNs and Transformer, with network architectural improvements designed to enrich the feature representation captured by the skip connections and the decoder. To this end, we devised a new attention module called Three-Level Attention (TLA). This module is composed of an Attention Gate (AG), channel attention, and spatial normalization mechanism. The AG preserves structural information, whereas channel attention helps to model the interdependencies between channels. Spatial normalization employs the spatial coefficient of the Transformer to improve spatial attention akin to TransNorm. To further improve the skip connection and reduce the semantic gap, skip connections between the encoder and decoder were redesigned in a manner similar to that of the UNet++ dense connection. Moreover, deep supervision using a side-output channel was introduced, analogous to BASNet, which was originally used for saliency predictions. Two datasets from different modalities, a CT scan dataset and an ultrasound dataset, were used to evaluate the proposed UNet architecture. The experimental results showed that our model consistently improved the prediction performance of the UNet across different datasets.",Generic
"Lymphoma is cancer originated in the lymphatic system. Clinically, automatic and accurate lymphoma segmentation is critical yet challenging. Recently, UNet-like architectures are widely used for medical image segmentation. The pure UNet-like architectures can model the spatial correlation between the feature maps very well, whereas they discard the critical temporal correlation. Some prior works combine UNet with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to utilize the spatial and temporal correlation simultaneously. However, it is inconvenient to incorporate some advanced techniques proposed for UNet to RNNs, which hampers their further improvements. In this paper, we propose a recurrent dense siamese decoder architecture, which simulates RNNs and can densely utilize the spatial temporal correlation between the decoder feature maps following a ""UNet"" approach. We combine it with a modified hyper dense encoder. Therefore, the proposed model is a UNet with a hyper dense encoder and a recurrent dense siamese decoder (HD-RDS-UNet). To stabilize the training process, we propose a weighted Dice loss with stable gradient and self-adaptive parameters. We perform patient-independent five-fold cross-validation on 3D volumes collected from whole-body PET/CT scans of patients with lymphomas. The experimental results show that the volume-wise average Dice score and sensitivity are 85.58% and 94.63%, respectively. The patient-wise average Dice score and sensitivity are 85.85% and 95.01%, respectively. The different configurations of HD-RDS-UNet consistently show superiority in the performance comparison. Besides, a trained HD-RDS-UNet can be easily pruned, resulting in significantly reduced inference time and memory usage, while keeping very good segmentation performance.",Generic
"Medical image segmentation is a crucial step in developing medical systems, especially for assisting doctors in diagnosing and treating diseases. Currently, UNet has become the preferred network for most medical image segmentation tasks and has achieved tremendous success. However, due to the limitations of convolutional operation mechanisms, its ability to model long-range dependencies between features is limited. With the success of transformers in the computer vision (CV) field, many excellent models that combine transformers with UNet have emerged, but most of them have fixed receptive fields and a single feature extraction method. To address this issue, we propose a transformer-CNN interactive (TCI) feature extraction module and use it to construct TCI-UNet. Specifically, we improve the self-attention mechanism in transformers to enhance the guiding ability of attention maps for computational resource allocation. It can strengthen the network's ability to capture global contextual information from feature maps. Additionally, we introduce local multi-scale information to supplement feature information, allowing the network to focus on important local information while modeling global contextual information. This improves the network's capability to extract feature map information and facilitates effective interaction between global and local information within the transformer, enhancing the representational power of transformers. We conducted a large number of experiments on the LiTS-2017 and ISIC-2018 datasets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, with DCIE values of 93.81% and 88.22%, respectively. Through ablation experiments, we proved the effectiveness of the TCI module, and in comparison with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) networks, we demonstrated the superiority of TCI-UNet in accuracy and generalization.",Generic
"<i>Objective</i>. Glioma is one of the most fatal cancers in the world which has been divided into low grade glioma (LGG) and high grade glioma (HGG), and its image grading has become a hot topic of contemporary research.

"In recent years, an increasing number of people have myopia in China, especially the younger generation. Common myopia may develop into high myopia. High myopia causes visual impairment and blindness. Parapapillary atrophy (PPA) is a typical retinal pathology related to high myopia, which is also a basic clue for diagnosing high myopia. Therefore, accurate segmentation of the PPA is essential for high myopia diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we propose an optimized Unet (OT-Unet) to solve this important task. OT-Unet uses one of the pre-trained models: Visual Geometry Group (VGG), ResNet, and Res2Net, as a backbone and is combined with edge attention, parallel partial decoder, and reverse attention modules to improve the segmentation accuracy. In general, using the pre-trained models can improve the accuracy with fewer samples. The edge attention module extracts contour information, the parallel partial decoder module combines the multi-scale features, and the reverse attention module integrates high- and low-level features. We also propose an augmented loss function to increase the weight of complex pixels to enable the network to segment more complex lesion areas. Based on a dataset containing 360 images (Including 26 pictures provided by PALM), the proposed OT-Unet achieves a high AUC (Area Under Curve) of 0.9235, indicating a significant improvement over the original Unet (0.7917).",Generic
"Automatic vessel segmentation is a key step of clinical or pre-clinical vessel bio-markers for clinical diagnosis.

To solve this problem, a Squeeze-Excitation Transformer U-net (SETUnet) is proposed to break the ROF limitation of CNN. The proposed squeeze-excitation Transformer can introduce the self attention mechanism into the vessel segmentation task by generating a global attention mapping according to the entire vessel image. To test the performance of the proposed SETUnet, the SETUnet is trained and tested on several public vessel data-sets.

It can not only accelerate the convergence speed, but also enrich the information exchange between patches and improve the understanding of local information. Then, it is integrated with UNet, a U-shaped architecture commonly used in medical image segmentation, to form a structure called ConvWin-UNet. Meanwhile, this paper improves the patch expanding layer to perform the upsampling operation. The experimental results on the Hubmap datasets and synapse multi-organ segmentation dataset indicate that the proposed ConvWin-UNet structure achieves excellent results. Partial code and models of this work are available at https://github.com/xmFeng-hdu/ConvWin-UNet.",Generic
"Accurate segmentation of frontal lobe areas on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can assist in diagnosing and managing idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus. However, frontal lobe segmentation is challenging due to the complexity of the degree and shape of damage and the ambiguity of the boundaries of frontal lobe sites. Therefore, to extract the rich edge information and feature representation of the frontal lobe, this paper designs an edge guidance (EG) module to enhance the representation of edge features. Accordingly, an edge-guided cascade network framework (EG-Net) is proposed to segment frontal lobe parts automatically. Two-dimensional MRI slice images are fed into the edge generation and segmentation networks. First, the edge generation network extracts the edge information from the input image. Then, the edge information is sent to the EG module to generate an edge attention map for feature representation enhancement. Meanwhile, multi-scale attentional convolution (MSA) is utilized in the feature coding stage of the segmentation network to obtain feature responses from different perceptual fields in the coding stage and enrich the spatial context information. Besides, the feature fusion module is employed to selectively aggregate the multi-scale features in the coding stage with the edge features output by the EG module. Finally, the two components are fused, and a decoder recovers the spatial information to generate the final prediction results. An extensive quantitative comparison is performed on a publicly available brain MRI dataset (MICCAI 2012) to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves an average DICE score of 95.77% compared to some advanced methods, which is 4.96% better than the classical U-Net. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed EG-Net in improving the accuracy of frontal edge pixel classification through edge guidance.",Generic

"Medical image segmentation plays a vital role in computer-aided diagnosis procedures. Recently, U-Net is widely used in medical image segmentation. Many variants of U-Net have been proposed, which attempt to improve the network performance while keeping the U-shaped structure unchanged. However, this U-shaped structure is not necessarily optimal. In this article, the effects of different parts of the U-Net on the segmentation ability are experimentally analyzed. Then a more efficient architecture, Half-UNet, is proposed. The proposed architecture is essentially an encoder-decoder network based on the U-Net structure, in which both the encoder and decoder are simplified. The re-designed architecture takes advantage of the unification of channel numbers, full-scale feature fusion, and Ghost modules. We compared Half-UNet with U-Net and its variants across multiple medical image segmentation tasks: mammography segmentation, lung nodule segmentation in the CT images, and left ventricular MRI image segmentation. Experiments demonstrate that Half-UNet has similar segmentation accuracy compared U-Net and its variants, while the parameters and floating-point operations are reduced by 98.6 and 81.8%, respectively, compared with U-Net.",Generic
"With the development of deep learning, medical image segmentation technology has made significant progress in the field of computer vision. The Unet is a pioneering work, and many researchers have conducted further research based on this architecture. However, we found that most of these architectures are improvements in the backward propagation and integration of the network, and few changes are made to the forward propagation and information integration of the network. Therefore, we propose a feedback mechanism Unet (FM-Unet) model, which adds feedback paths to the encoder and decoder paths of the network, respectively, to help the network fuse the information of the next step in the current encoder and decoder. The problem of encoder information loss and decoder information shortage can be well solved. The proposed model has more moderate network parameters, and the simultaneous multi-node information fusion can alleviate the gradient disappearance. We have conducted experiments on two public datasets, and the results show that FM-Unet achieves satisfactory results.",Generic
"Roads are important mode of transportation, which are very convenient for people's daily work and life. However, it is challenging to accuratly extract road information from a high-resolution remote sensing image.

Firstly, the standard UNet is used to roughly extract road information from remote sensing images, getting the first segmentation result; secondly, a fixed threshold is utilized to erase partial extracted information; thirdly, a multi-scale dense dilated convolution UNet (MD-UNet) is introduced to discover the complement road areas in the erased masks, obtaining the second segmentation result; and, finally, we fuse the extraction results of the first and the third modules, getting the final segmentation results. Experimental results on the Massachusetts Road dataset indicate that our C-UNet gets the higher results than the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.",Generic
"Quantitative photoacoustic tomography (QPAT) is a valuable tool in characterizing ovarian lesions for accurate diagnosis. However, accurately reconstructing a lesion's optical absorption distributions from photoacoustic signals measured with multiple wavelengths is challenging because it involves an ill-posed inverse problem with three unknowns: the Gr neisen parameter <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mo>(</mo> <mi> </mi> <mo>)</mo></mrow> </math> , the absorption distribution, and the optical fluence <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mo>(</mo> <mi> </mi> <mo>)</mo></mrow> </math> .

A pre-trained ResNet-18 extracts the US features typically identified as morphologies of suspicious ovarian lesions, and a Unet is implemented to reconstruct optical absorption coefficient maps, using the initial pressure and US features extracted by ResNet-18. To test this US-Unet model, we calculated the blood oxygenation saturation values and total hemoglobin concentrations from 655 regions of interest (ROIs) (421 benign, 200 malignant, and 34 borderline ROIs) obtained from clinical images of 35 patients with ovarian/adnexal lesions. A logistic regression model was used to compute the ROC, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.94, and the accuracy was 0.89.

"In biomedical image analysis, information about the location and appearance of tumors and lesions is indispensable to aid doctors in treating and identifying the severity of diseases. Therefore, it is essential to segment the tumors and lesions. MRI, CT, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray are the different imaging systems to obtain this information. The well-known semantic segmentation technique is used in medical image analysis to identify and label regions of images. The semantic segmentation aims to divide the images into regions with comparable characteristics, including intensity, homogeneity, and texture.

"Precise segmentation is in demand for hepatocellular carcinoma or metastasis clinical diagnosis due to the heterogeneous appearance and diverse anatomy of the liver on scanned abdominal computed tomography (CT) images. In this study, we present an automatic unified registration-free deep-learning-based model with residual block and dilated convolution for training end-to-end liver and lesion segmentation. A multi-scale approach has also been utilized to explore novel inter-slice features with multi-channel input images. A novel objective function is introduced to deal with fore- and background pixels imbalance based on the joint metric of dice coefficient and absolute volumetric difference. Further, batch normalization is used to improve the learning without any loss of useful information. The proposed methodology is extensively validated and tested on 30% of the publicly available Dircadb, LiTS, Sliver07, and Chaos datasets.

"Deep learning based medical image segmentation methods have been widely used for thyroid gland segmentation from ultrasound images, which is of great importance for the diagnosis of thyroid disease since it can provide various valuable sonography features. However, existing thyroid gland segmentation models suffer from: (1) low-level features that are significant in depicting thyroid boundaries are gradually lost during the feature encoding process, (2) contextual features reflecting the changes of difference between thyroid and other anatomies in the ultrasound diagnosis process are either omitted by 2D convolutions or weakly represented by 3D convolutions due to high redundancy. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid transformer UNet (H-TUNet) to segment thyroid glands in ultrasound sequences, which consists of two parts: (1) a 2D Transformer UNet is proposed by utilizing a designed multi-scale cross-attention transformer (MSCAT) module on every skipped connection of the UNet, so that the low-level features from different encoding layers are integrated and refined according to the high-level features in the decoding scheme, leading to better representation of differences between anatomies in one ultrasound frame; (2) a 3D Transformer UNet is proposed by applying a 3D self-attention transformer (SAT) module to the very bottom layer of 3D UNet, so that the contextual features representing visual differences between regions and consistencies within regions could be strengthened from successive frames in the video. The learning process of the H-TUNet is formulated as a unified end-to-end network, so the intra-frame feature extraction and inter-frame feature aggregation can be learned and optimized jointly.

"Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have provided promising solutions to medical image segmentation. Among existing segmentation approaches, the U-Net-based methods have been used widely. However, very few U-Net-based studies have been conducted on automatic segmentation of the human brain claustrum (CL). The CL segmentation is challenging due to its thin, sheet-like structure, heterogeneity of its image modalities and formats, imperfect labels, and data imbalance. We propose an automatic optimized U-Net-based 3D segmentation model, called AM-UNet, designed as an end-to-end process of the pre and post-process techniques and a U-Net model for CL segmentation. It is a lightweight and scalable solution which has achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy for automatic CL segmentation on 3D magnetic resonance images (MRI).

"To obtain a high-resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI), fusing a low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) and a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) is a prominent approach. Numerous approaches based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been presented for hyperspectral image (HSI) and multispectral image (MSI) fusion. Nevertheless, these CNN-based methods may ignore the global relevant features from the input image due to the geometric limitations of convolutional kernels. To obtain more accurate fusion results, we provide a spatial-spectral transformer-based U-net (SSTF-Unet). Our SSTF-Unet can capture the association between distant features and explore the intrinsic information of images. More specifically, we use the spatial transformer block (SATB) and spectral transformer block (SETB) to calculate the spatial and spectral self-attention, respectively. Then, SATB and SETB are connected in parallel to form the spatial-spectral fusion block (SSFB). Inspired by the U-net architecture, we build up our SSTF-Unet through stacking several SSFBs for multiscale spatial-spectral feature fusion. Experimental results on public HSI datasets demonstrate that the designed SSTF-Unet achieves better performance than other existing HSI and MSI fusion approaches.",Generic
"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes complication that can cause vision loss among patients due to damage to blood vessels in the retina. Early retinal screening can avoid the severe consequences of DR and enable timely treatment. Nowadays, researchers are trying to develop automated deep learning-based DR segmentation tools using retinal fundus images to help Ophthalmologists with DR screening and early diagnosis. However, recent studies are unable to design accurate models due to the unavailability of larger training data with consistent and fine-grained annotations. To address this problem, we propose a semi-supervised multitask learning approach that exploits widely available unlabelled data (i.e., Kaggle-EyePACS) to improve DR segmentation performance. The proposed model consists of novel multi-decoder architecture and involves both unsupervised and supervised learning phases. The model is trained for the unsupervised auxiliary task to effectively learn from additional unlabelled data and improve the performance of the primary task of DR segmentation.

"Accurate segmentation of medical images is crucial for clinical diagnosis and evaluation.

"Unsupervised image segmentation is a technique that divides an image into distinct regions or objects without prior labeling. This approach offers flexibility and adaptability to various types of image data. Particularly for large datasets, it eliminates the need for manual labeling, thereby it presents advantages in terms of time and labor costs. However, when applied to retinal image segmentation, challenges arise due to variations in data, presence of noise, and manual threshold adjustments, which can lead to over-segmentation or under-segmentation of small blood vessel boundaries and endpoints. In order to enhance the precision and accuracy of retinal image segmentation, we propose a novel image supervised segmentation network based on three-path Unet model.Firstly, the Haar wavelet transform is employed to extract high-frequency image information, which forms the foundation for the proposed HaarNet, a Unet-inspired architecture. Next, the HaarNet is integrated with the Unet and SegNet frameworks to develop a three-path Unet model, referred to as TP-Unet. Finally, the model is further refined into TP-Unet+AE+DSL by incorporating the advantages of auto-encoding (AE) and deep supervised learning (DSL) techniques, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the system.

"A supervised deep learning network like the UNet has performed well in segmenting brain anomalies such as lesions and tumours. However, such methods were proposed to perform on single-modality or multi-modality images.

"The global annual incidence of brain tumors is approximately seven out of 100,000, accounting for 2% of all tumors. The mortality rate ranks first among children under 12 and 10th among adults.

"We present a sample-efficient image segmentation method using active learning, we call it Active Bayesian UNet, or AB-UNet. This is a convolutional neural network using batch normalization and max-pool dropout. The Bayesian setup is achieved by exploiting the probabilistic extension of the dropout mechanism, leading to the possibility to use the uncertainty inherently present in the system. We set up our experiments on various medical image datasets and highlight that with a smaller annotation effort our AB-UNet leads to stable training and better generalization. Added to this, we can efficiently choose from an unlabelled dataset.",Generic
"The state-of-the-art models for medical image segmentation are variants of U-Net and fully convolutional networks (FCN). Despite their success, these models have two limitations: (1) their optimal depth is apriori unknown, requiring extensive architecture search or inefficient ensemble of models of varying depths; and (2) their skip connections impose an unnecessarily restrictive fusion scheme, forcing aggregation only at the same-scale feature maps of the encoder and decoder sub-networks. To overcome these two limitations, we propose UNet++, a new neural architecture for semantic and instance segmentation, by (1) alleviating the unknown network depth with an efficient ensemble of U-Nets of varying depths, which partially share an encoder and co-learn simultaneously using deep supervision; (2) redesigning skip connections to aggregate features of varying semantic scales at the decoder sub-networks, leading to a highly flexible feature fusion scheme; and (3) devising a pruning scheme to accelerate the inference speed of UNet++. We have evaluated UNet++ using six different medical image segmentation datasets, covering multiple imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electron microscopy (EM), and demonstrating that (1) UNet++ consistently outperforms the baseline models for the task of semantic segmentation across different datasets and backbone architectures; (2) UNet++ enhances segmentation quality of varying-size objects-an improvement over the fixed-depth U-Net; (3) Mask RCNN++ (Mask R-CNN with UNet++ design) outperforms the original Mask R-CNN for the task of instance segmentation; and (4) pruned UNet++ models achieve significant speedup while showing only modest performance degradation. Our implementation and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/MrGiovanni/UNetPlusPlus.",Generic
"Precise segmentation of organs at risk (OARs) in computed tomography (CT) images is an essential step for lung cancer radiotherapy. However, the manual delineation of OARs is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variation. Although U-like architecture has achieved great success in medical image segmentation recently, it exhibits the limitations in modeling long-range dependencies. As an alternative structure, Transformers have emerged due to the outstanding capability of capturing the global contextual information provided by Self-Attention(SA) mechanism. However, Transformers need more computational cost than CNNs for introducing the SA module. In this paper, we propose a novel module named fine-grained combination of Transformer and CNN(FcTC). FcTC module is composed of dual-path extractor and fusing unit to effectively extract local information and model long-distance dependency. Then we build FcTC-UNet to automatically segment the OARs in thoracic CT images. The experiments results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance over other state-of-the-art methods.",Generic
"Oil and gas reservoirs are of great significance for economic benefits. Faults act as important conduits for transporting hydrocarbons and as essential sealing conditions. The location and morphology of faults reflect changes in the shape of the strata, so fault interpretation of seismic data has been an essential task in oil and gas exploration and development. The traditional fault identification method is time-consuming and inaccurate with large uncertainties. This paper proposed a fault recognition method based on 3D-UNet that added attention mechanisms to a convolutional neural network (CNN). This approach takes advantage of the UNet end-to-end architecture and the attention mechanism to focus on essential areas and suppress irrelevant information, allowing the model to focus on more valuable features. A fault identification network for seismic data was proposed by combining the 3D-UNet architecture with the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention mechanism. The 3D-UNet architecture comprises two parts: encoding and decoding, and the network architecture realizes end-to-end training. At the same time, SE was used to focus on the advantages of feature channels, further improving the accuracy of the network. The model performance was evaluated using the synthetic dataset provided by Wu. Experimental results show that the proposed model has better prediction performance in terms of accuracy, better recognition continuity, and richer fault detail.",Generic
"Accurate and efficient segmentation of thyroid nodules on ultrasound images is critical for computer-aided nodule diagnosis and treatment. For ultrasound images, Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, which are widely used in natural images, cannot obtain satisfactory segmentation results, because they either cannot obtain precise boundaries or segment small objects.",Generic
